This page collects quotes and anecdotes on John von Neumann beyond those listed on his [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) pages. Von Neumann famously was lightning quick, both in calculations and in understanding. While there are many mathematicians and physicists who have been known for being quick, von Neumann in my view is unique in the sheer volume of anecdotes he has contributed to, and while in the modern age it is easy to dismiss them as perhaps being some trick or something that can also be done by others through hard work and effort, the widespread belief one gets from reading all these anecdotes is that von Neumann was indeed unique in his abilities.

"I had the good fortune at Los Alamos of learning things from Von Neumann. That’s a most remarkable man—so straightforward. He could make the most difficult subject appear easy. He would lay it out for you, and it was obvious. And you can learn things so readily from a man like that."

-- ROBERT F. CHRISTY, 1994 Interview

"von Neumann was a legend in his own time, which is why we had proposed him as the judge of our project’s worth: his voice carried unique weight. He was renowned not just for the depth and originality of his thought, but for the sheer speed with which his mind worked. He was a lightning calculator with a photographic memory."

"He had no printed formulas or tables available. He had an almost instantaneous method for calculating the cosine of *t* and square roots—perhaps he had them all in memory—and was stunningly rapid at making estimates."

-- Irving S. Reed, "The Dawn of the Computer Age"

"I remember having listened in his office to discussions on hydrodynamics with von Neumann. They took the strange form of a competition in front of a blackboard to see who could first solve the problem; von Neumann, using his insuperable lightning analytical skill, usually won."

"Enrico reported on a recent trip to Los Alamos, where he collaborated with the Hungarian mathematician and computer master Johnny von Neumann on some undisclosed problem, As Enrico reported, Johnny was calling on obscure changes of variables, unheard-of transforms, and, for all I remember, the Heimlich maneuver, in a tour de force solution of the problem, completed in jig time. Enrico turned to us with a quizzical look on his face and said, “You know, I felt like the fly who sits on the plow and says, ‘We are plowing.’” Wreathed in smiles, we all fell off our chairs."

"At times Fermi showed his admiration for the skills of others. One Friday night Herb Anderson was treating our graduate student group to dinner, but Herb showed up at the restaurant quite late. In making his apology, Herb (who was then directing the Institute for Nuclear Studies) told us that he had been waiting to consult with Enrico but had not wanted to interrupt the discussion Enrico was having with that day’s guest, John von Neumann. Herb recounted that when he finally saw Enrico, Fermi started  off by saying how impressive von Neumann was: "You know, Herb, Johnny can do calculations in his head ten times as fast as I can!" Enrico continued, with some humor, "And I can do them ten times as fast as you can, Herb, so you can see how  impressive Johnny is!" Since Herb was no slouch at figuring things in his head, we were properly impressed."

-- Fermi Remembered book

"Von Neumann had been blessed with one of the most remarkable intellects of our generation , and an engaging personality. He was a mathematical authority, recognized around the world in his field of specialization, but his interests were unusually broad. He was an expert on the subject of Byzantine art and architecture. He was completely current in international politics and followed the stream of history with a deep personal concern for the adverse influences which he believed were eroding the welfare and safety of the country of his adoption. He was passionately devoted to the service of the United States. Von Neumann also had a spontaneous humor and an inexhaustible fund of anecdote. A memory which seemed to operate with even more speed than his machines enabled him to bring up, from his vast and well-indexed mental filing system, stories appropriate to whatever occasion.

Dr. Shields Warren, the world-famous radiologist, who was a member of our delegation, explained to me the gravity of the diagnosis and volunteered to leave at once for Washington to take Johnny under his care.

Until the last, he continued to be a member of the Commission and chairman of an important advisory committee to the Defense Department, On one dramatic occasion, I was present at a meeting at Walter Reed Hospital, where, gathered around Johnny’s bedside were the Secretary of Defense and his deputies, the Secretaries of the three Armed Services, and all the military Chiefs of Staff. The central figure was a young man who but a few years before had come to the United States as an immigrant."

-- Lewis Strauss, Men and Decisions

"'The scientific worker of the future will more and more resemble the lonely figure of Daedalus as he becomes conscious of his ghastly mission and proud of it.' Of all the scientists I have known , the one who came closest in character to Haldane's Daedalus was not a biologist but a mathematician , by name John von Neumann. To those who knew von Neumann only through his outward appearance, rotund and jovial, it may seem ludicrously inappropriate to compare him with Daedalus. But those who knew him personally, this man who consciously and deliberately set mankind moving along the road that led us into the age of computers, will understand that from a psychological point of view Haldane' s portrait of him was extraordinarily prophetic."

-- Freeman Dyson, Disturbing the Universe

"Von Neumann got involved in a very effective way and the obvious answer to all our muddled questions was there. I had no contacts with von Neumann himself that I can remember, but all the people in the laboratory told me how one now, according to von Neumann, looked at the problems, and it was so obvious and was so simple. It was really an enormous impression to see how a fundamental -- I don't know what you should call it -- problem or really a fundamental field of questions could not be managed by hundreds of ordinary- sized brains, where one brain of von Neumann's class did it."

"But I think Kent's influence was basically of a different kind. It was much more of a human kind, making von Neumann and others feel that Aberdeen was somewhere that he really was appreciated and could work. I remember seeing von Neumann and Kent extremely happy and a little tipsy at some evening party of the laboratory and just having a terribly good time singing all sorts of songs together. So it is, I think, sort of that emotional, human background which in upset times, like the war, can play a terribly important role even for a scientist as basically logical as von Neumann was."

"I would like to say that my impression was that in all the years after the war whenever you visited one of the installations with a modern mainframe computer, you would always find somebody doing a shock wave problem. If you asked them how they came to be working on that, it was always von Neumann who put them onto it. So they became sort of the foot print of von Neumann, walking across the scene of modern computers."

"It was a frustrating time in a certain sense, but it was also an incredibly exciting time. The dominant sense was that you knew this was a development that was going to go forward and that in your lifetime you would see enormous changes. I think that was very clearly understood by von Neumann and we all just followed him in that aspect. So the frustrations, well, you learned how to take them. I think none of us would have thought of wanting to get away from the machines; we were so convinced they would get technically better."

"There was one other aspect. As a person von Neumann was extremely tense and quite often the likelihood of getting actual numerical results was very much larger if he was not in the computer room because everybody got so nervous when he was there. But when you were in real thinking trouble, you would go to von Neumann and nobody else."

-- Martin Schwartzchild, 1986 Interview with Aspray

"And I've known now more than three of four geniuses in my time and von Neumann was among the top. He was simply amazing -- just no question about it."

"Let me admit that being extremely naive, I was not knowledgeable about great mathematicians except from a little bit of contact with professors on campus. With no knowledge of who they were or why. Von Neumann was just another man when he came but I don't think it was more than an hour and a half after I first met him that I began to appreciate what kind of person he was."

-- S. Reed Warren, 1977 Interview with Stern

"He of course was always interested in engineering, physics, etc. But I think he saw much less of the ENIAC than he did of the Institute project. I think he got bored with being to close to it. Now he used to love to go over to RCA with Bigelow and me to talk to Rajchman; he would enjoy those conversations. I think he had an intellectual interest in things like this. It wasn't a sustained interest, you know. I mean, if there were a new idea, that thrilled him to understand it, that would be one thing. But the experimental business wasn't really for von Neumann. He understood that things took time to perfect and that there was a lot of horsing around, but that really didn't turn him on. When we were actually running, he would come down for the evening--I might be trying to do something, and he'd spend any number of hours with me as long as I was willing to stay--he was willing to stay--to try to get something mathematical fixed. That was a kind of a deeper interest for him. The other was a kind of nervous interest. He wanted to know all about a new thing. But once he understood the principle of it, the ghastly details like the fact that you'd have to put by-pass condensers on things, and all sorts of dirty engineering things--that didn't really interest him. He recognized that these were essential, but it wasn't his thing. He would not have had the patience to sit there and do it; he would have made a lousy engineer.

Well, you know--he was great for coming into a complex, theoretical situation where he could bring to it a kind of clarity of mind that almost nobody else possessed and solve the problem. That was what he was great at. But if he couldn't bring that to it, then he was only annoyed with it, you know. So he would walk away. If that helps you to understand him.

If you ever look at Gauss' collected works, you'll see Gauss also love to calculate. You just find in Gauss' works huge calculations that he undertook. It was a form of recreation. Von Neumann loved to do these things. It was a kind of being in touch with reality in a peculiar way. He would live to play mathematical games, such as the question of whether the numbers on a box car were prime or composite. He did calculations in his head that nobody else could do. He loved to do things like that. It was just part of his make-up. So calculation was not something abhorrent. Again, if you look in Gauss' collected works, you'll find all kinds of tabular things that he did. In fact, it was probably relaxing for each one of them to turn to calculation just for the fun of it."

"But I think he love to calculate. If you look at his book on quantum mechanics you'll find a number of things that you might conceivably do by other methods, he did do them by not numerical calculation, but by algebraical calculation. He was masterful at it. He could take the most elaborate formulas and manipulate them down until they were a couple of terms. This he loved. This was part of his virtuosity. You know, there was just nothing he liked so much as to do that. Numerical calculations were a first cousin to that.

So at any rate, I think that's one reason why he got into computing. Well you know, of course, that during the war he was involved with the implosion bomb, and it was the calculations for the implosion device that were what originally got him deeply into numerical calculations. You have to find out how to shape the lenses, because if you don't get them shaped just right--a hole may appear out of which the contents would just squirt. Were he alive today, the plasma physics lab here in Princeton, you know, would have interested him; the work on the Tokamak here at Princeton--would have been just what he would have loved; because there one tries to contain a mass of material at enormous temperatures, like the temperature of the sun for a reasonable length of time; one tries to contain the material in a magnetic bottle. This is an enormous design problem, and that he would have just eaten up. But at any rate, that was what he liked."

"I just don't believe any of us could have gone and persuaded somebody like Fermi of the importance of numerical calculation the way von Neumann could because von Neumann actually was the only person that I know who could take a physical situation, write down the differential equations and put it into numerical form. He knew all about Courant's work back in the early-whenever it was--early '30s, with Friedrichs and Lewy--so he was the only person who really could do calculations involving partial differential equations; and he was also the only person who could formulate mathematically the incredibly complicated physical problems, which they were meeting. And so that's why people like Fermi were immediately impressed, and that's why the computer spread so quickly and so widely. I think those are the things which von Neumann contributed."

"STERN: And I think he would be able to get a group to focus on numerical mathematics, as he did at the Institute, based on his reputation.

GOLDSTINE: Well, sure. It was based on his reputation, his stature. No other institution had a chance. Whirlwind--if you read that Redmond and Smith book--had the half-time use of Philip Franklin, and two full-time assistants whose names they don't even mention. So it was a little mathematical project. Whereas the group at the Institute had all first class people--every one of them was anxious to come. It was the place where these things were going on Douglas Hartree used to visit the place periodically. You mentioned the Todds-- .. You can keep on naming the people--there was a very long list of famous people who were there. Very important things got done, as a result. All of this served to show the world, including the numerical meteorology people, that the computer was a very very important thing."

-- Herman Goldstine, 1980 Interview with Stern

"On the other hand, I have been happy to meet Von Neumann, my senior by only twenty years, who was a passionate man of exceptional intelligence that shone in his face and words. He was not a kindly old man like Einstein, but a man in the prime of life, with a pessimistic view of humanity."

-- Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, A Lady Mathematician in this Strange Universe

"The man who most clearly envisioned numerical fluid dynamics as we know it today was John von Neumann. It was an electrifying experience to hear him propose in 1945, in a lecture given at the First Canadian Mathematical Congress, that computers might be used instead of wind-tunnels to simulate the flow of air around airplanes. In one sense, this was a bold reaffirmation of the thesis of Euler and Lagrange, that fluid dynamics could be treated as a mathematical science. However, it radically revised  his thesis, which had gradually disintegrated in the two centuries 1740-1940. It proposed complementing analytical fluid dynamics by numerical fluid dynamics."

"It is a pity that no written version of von Neumann's talk seems to exist. However, I can vouch for the correctness of  the preceding statements, because I was there and it was my  unenviable task to be the next speaker. My chosen topic of  "Universal Algebra" had seemed imaginative enough beforehand,  but it paled into insignificance when presented just after von Neumann had finished!"

"We can sum them up by saying that he played a prominent role in fulfilling his own prophecy: that the cost of scientific computing would decrease by many orders of magnitude within a few decades."

"Although he had access to the best computing machines existing in his lifetime, such as the Univac and the IBM-704, these were quite puny by modern standards. Hence it is his ideas about numerical fluid dynamics, rather than any specific computing achievements, that of the greatest significance today."

"Von Neumann had only 10 years after his Montreal talk in which to develop his ideas. The boldness of his imagination becomes especially impressive when we consider the limited capabilities of the leading digital computer of 1945: the ENIAC with its negligible "memory" and Howard Aiken's slow electromechanical Selective Sequence Calculator."

-- Garrett Birkhoff, Numerical Fluid Dynamics

"I would say this. He knew he had a mind that moved in rapid fashion on any subject relating to mathematics or physics."

-- Richard Bloch, 1984 Interview with Aspray

"He was a very amiable and friendly person, cheerful, obviously very intelligent, and obviously interested in really understanding things down to details. I can remember one occasion when the five of us -- it was Goldstine, Mauchly, Eckert, Burks and von Neumann -- tried to explain how one aspect of the ENIAC worked, and I thought the explanation was clear. Von Neumann clearly couldn't understand, and in fact there was something missing. I mean we were assuming a lot that we hadn't yet told him. 

But he was not the kind of guy who would say, "Oh yes." That is, if there was something missing he told you "I don't understand it"

Now he would not have understood some of the details of the tubes, of course, and why we would be using this tube rather than another tube. So he was not current on engineering details, but he understood the concepts very well.."

"Von Neumann was presented as a physicist/mathematician. His book on the theory of games had come out not too long before, but it soon became clear that he knew enough engineering that we could talk with him about engineering."

"Well you can see the difference now in style in that von Neumann, after a relatively small number of days in consultation (total number of days), got the problem formulated in his mind, in the background, and then his next step was to write this long draft report. Well, that was just the opposite of the way Eckert and Mauchly wrote their [later] report, and of course it was part of von Neumann's style because von Neumann had six different things in the fire; that is, he was at Los Alamos telling them how to make an A bomb at the time he would be writing this up in the evening."

"Well, yes, he had a very wide range in interests. He had this basic design which is reflected in the paper that he, and Herman and I, wrote, which is different from the EDVAC design. I think he saw too what I didn't see at the time, that there would be a great demand for these computers. So if he was to have a computer to use he would probably have to build his own, because if he waited for the others it might be a long time -- not before computers would be finished, but before he would have sufficient access to them. I think Herman was encouraging him in this. Herman wanted to go ahead to build a computer and saw an opportunity for himself in working with von Neumann. On this von Neumann had a lot of confidence in himself to manage all these things at once. So anyhow, it became clear, it didn't take me long to realize that Herman and von Neumann were right that things wouldn't work out very well at the Moore School if von Neumann tried to work things that way. So if he really wanted a computer the thing to do was to build it. After I came to the Institute it soon became apparent that the other people at the Institute weren't enthusiastic about such an experimental thing. They were doing it because von Neumann wanted it, but he clearly had enough prestige that if Johnny wanted it he could have it.

I liked very much working with von Neumann. I was very much impressed by him."

-- Arthur and Alice Burks, 1980 Interview with Stern

"I suppose the word brilliant always occurs, highly articulate, versatile, personable, charming, a few eccentricities.

He always wore the same suit.

It was hardly ever pressed. He always liked to run up the stairs, and he was awkward at it and I never knew why he wanted to do that. But he liked to run upstairs two at a time. When he drove a car and the conversation lagged he would sing. The tune was indistinguishable, so he would sway from side to side like this and the car wouldn't go very straight, and it was quite an exciting thing to ride in the car with him, and I always tried to arrange it so that I could drive. That was unusual.

He had to have hard rolls for breakfast. We were in the Amsterdam Hotel once having breakfast, and they brought him some kind of dutch bread, and he asked for hard rolls. He got more and more upset, and I finally got up and went to the kitchen and asked for rolls which they brought to him. You know, terribly upset about the one little thing, so it was unusual.

He was very approachable, very approachable.

And their was a colonel I think in the air force who was his psychiatrist, and somebody told me that when John got interested in psychiatry, that he quickly learned more about formal psychiatry, than the people who the psychiatrist knew.

Well, yes. I think it would be clearer that he knew at that time as much about neurophysiology as was known.

You asked once of a great man talking to the subordinates, in our association he never talked down to me. But in almost every case he always was far ahead of me in his thoughts about a subject. He never talked down to me, but I know he had lots of thoughts including the one that you just talked about, but he never discussed them.

One of the interesting things about that, when Von Neumann came to study some of the subjects that we had, such as this question of how to make a 701 do commercial light work like the 702 did, Von Neumann would take an algorithm and write the code in his head. And that was the only way Glaser could do it, was to write codes in his head. So we had the two people who for quite different reasons were writing code in their head. Either could correct it in the middle of it and then write some more code. It was very interesting to see the two. And Von Neumann was faster, but Ted['s] memory was as good on that kind of thing. So he was there. And I think those are the principle ones who were coding on the 701.

I had the job of finding candidates for the Director of Research. Von Neumann was one of the persons nominated for Director of Research. They wanted an outstanding scientist. They didn't care about anyone who was interested in managership, although clearly Von Neumann could have [managed].

The other thing was, Von Neumann because of his reputation as a mathematician would gain the confidence of people and because he was so highly articulate gave people confidence in the fact that a computer if built would work, it would be a success. And I want to support that thing by two, two instances. When I first met Teller, and I don't know when that was, in 1954, and Livermore got one of the first Univacs and Livermore got one of the first 701s. When I first met him, Teller said to me that the fact that Von Neumann, for whom he had the greatest respect, and who had some experience with computers felt, that use of the computer would be highly useful at Livermore, that that fact was a deciding influence on Teller's part, on deciding to make the investment. It was a big investment, it wasn't a money, it was the investment that knowing you had to have, at that time problems weren't very well, weren't well formulated for computers there wasn't any systems analysis. There were no programming aids whatsoever. It was a big investment to make a computer, in the stand point that you have to have people, so the confidence that he gave Teller was a very important thing for Teller, and of course as soon as Teller made the decision other people would make the decision on the same basis, just because Teller did. I can illustrate it another way. I talked to, I just happened to be talking to Tom Watson, over the phone to Watson, and he said "Cuthbert I always remember the time you brought Von Neumann up to see us, and Von Neumann gave us confidence in what we were doing". And I don't know whether this memorandum that I read to you about his list, we talked about several, I have no idea what it was, but someplace along the line when IBM was taking risks, of going from an old established business where they make good profit and good growth, and everybody is happy, into a new field, that gave Tom Watson Jr. confidence in the project. So I think Von Neumann's personal influence in that sense because he was thought to be so good in his own field, and was so articulate."

-- Cuthbert Hurd, 1981 Interview with Stern

"But his role, not only during the war but after its conclusion, was unique; for he was a consultant or other participant in so many government or learned activities that his influence was very broadly felt."

-- Minas Rees, The Mathematical Sciences and World War II

"The mathematical ascendancy achieved by our country in the 1930's owes much to John von Neumann (1903-1957), one of the most scintillating minds of this century. Born into a well-to-do Budapest banking family, he was always brilliant, getting advanced degrees in both chemical engineering and mathematics in 1926. By that time, he had already proposed new axiomatic foundations for set theory.

His famous *Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik* presented his reformulation of quantum mechanics in book form and made so-called 'operator theory' fashionable overnight. This book has served as an inspiration and model for mathematicians interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics ever since.

The die was cast; von Neumann began publishing in English, and instantly became a leading *American* mathematician.

But above all, he was interacting with American mathematicians of all ages, helping to set the mathematical style of the 1930's which I shall discuss next."

-- Garrett Birkhoff, Some Leaders in American Mathematics: 1891-1941

"V. Neumann was a key figure in the transition from pre-war to post-war mathematics.

However, no mere list of v. Neumann's achievements gives a proper picture of the man; for those who are too young to have glimpsed him I offer the image of Gelfand and Michael Atiyah rolled into one, with a couple of physicists and economists added for good measure. He carried thinking farther than most people can conceive of its being carried.

Not only the government but many mathematicians sought v. Neumann's advice about their research. Not that v. Neumann was able to solve a difficult problem in a single interview, but he had an uncanny ability of relating it to other problems. Often such a reformulation represented the labor of six months of the person who posed the question.

In spite of his superhuman ability for analysis, v. Neumann was not always right; e.g., he was against floating point arithmetic and against large core memory for computers. But his influence on the whole was overwhelmingly good and his premature death robbed applied mathematics and computer science of a natural leader, a spokesman and a bridge to other sciences."

-- Peter D. Lax, The Bomb, Sputnik, Computers, and European Mathematicians

"von Neumann was equipped with 'the fastest mind I ever met'"

-- Lothar Nordheim, Hilbert

"Mr. von Neumann, in spite of his youth, is a completely exceptional personality ... who has already done very productive work ... and whose future development is being watched with great expectation in many places"

-- Courant, Courant

"He was considered by many to be the leading mathematician in the world."

"Yes, people would come to him because of his great insight. In the initial stages of the development of a new field like linear programming, atomic physics, computers or whatever, his advice proved invaluable. After these fields were developed in greater depth, however, it became increasingly more difficult for him to make the same spectacular contributions. I guess everyone has a finite capacity, and Johnny was no exception."

-- George Danzig, More Mathematical People

"Von Neumann, who was the central figure of the mid-century, firmly believed that computing was central not only to the numerical side of applied mathematics but also to progress in theory. That is why he invented computers and pushed for their development. He foresaw that computations are essential to discover basic phenomena in nonlinear systems."

-- Peter Lax, More Mathematical People

"That was for me an entirely unbelievable experience because some time in between (I do not know the details at all) Von Neumann got involved in a very effective way and the obvious answer to all our muddled questions was there. I had no contacts with von Neumann himself that I can remember, but all the people in the laboratory told me how one now, according to von Neumann, looked at the problems, and it was so obvious and was so simple. It was really an enormous impression to see how a fundamental -- I don't know what you should call it -- problem or really a fundamental field of questions could not be managed by hundreds of ordinary sized brains, where one brain of von Neumann's class did it.

I mean, I think what I know is exactly as I described how dumb we were early in 1943 and how everything seemed terribly plain and straight-forward in 1944. In Aberdeen, that change was clearly due to von Neumann.

But I think Kent's influence was basically of a different kind. It was much more of a human kind, making von Neumann and others feel that Aberdeen was somewhere that he really was appreciated and could work. I remember seeing von Neumann and Kent extremely happy and a little tipsy at some evening party of the laboratory and just having a terribly good time singing all sorts of songs together. So it is, I think, sort of that emotional, human background which in upset times, like the war, can play a terribly important role even for a scientist as basically logical as von Neumann was.

I would like to say that my impression was that in all the years after the war whenever you visited one of the installations with a modern mainframe computer, you would always find somebody doing a shock wave problem. If you asked them how they came to be working on that, it was always von Neumann who put them onto it.

I think none of us would have thought of wanting to get away from the machines; we were so convinced they would get technically better."

"The danger was just that you got thrown off. There was one other aspect. As a person von Neumann was extremely tense and quite often the likelihood of getting actual numerical results was very much larger if he was not in the computer room because everybody got so nervous when he was there. But when you were in real thinking trouble, you would go to von Neumann and nobody else."

-- Martin Schwarzschild, 1986 Interview with Aspray

"He was a very extraordinary man. I've known quite a few mathematicians from the great to near great, and he was like none that I'd ever met before. He was not a narrow person, he wasn't the sort of person who's a bit of a freak and knows only one subject extremely well. He knew many things well. He thought like anyone else, but much faster. He could penetrate much more deeply than most. A little unnerving."

"There were many things in mathematics that I did not know, which I had to learn very rapidly. There were no formal classes at the Institute, so I was forced to pick up as much as I could by reading or by inventing it myself, or directing questions to von Neumann. If he couldn't give me the answers very quickly, he immediately gave me a good reference to get a start."

-- Philip Thompson, 1986 Interview with Aspray

"There still was a great deal of influence on the work in Fine Hall from people at the Institute, especially Weyl and von Neumann and Marston Morse"

"Von Neumann did his work wherever he had the happened to be."

-- Albert Tucker, 1986 Interview with Aspray

"Our mathematics teacher, Lazll Racz (?) noticed what gifts he had as a mathematician. And he gave him private classes -- a great many -- about three times a week. He refused any compensation for it even though Johnny's parents were quite wealthy. But he felt he did it for himself, and he was a wonderful teacher."

ASPRAY: Was he also taking classes at the University while he was still in high school, or studying with the professors?

WIGNER: I don't think so, but I can't be absolutely sure. But he was very much taken care of by this Moratt (?) and other teachers who thought very highly of him and even liked him.

"We met sometimes. We took walks together. He liked to walk and explain things and teach me a little mathematics, a little history perhaps. And it was very nice. But these were walks.

And I took many more walks with other friends who also were interested in conversations."

"And we often attended the same colloquium, although he rarely came to the physics colloquium."

"Oh, he knew a great deal of physics. I don't think his contributions were to basic physics (except for this one, which turned out to have been very important). I don't know of any other very basic contribution of his. He was not so much interested in small phenomena and special theories. It was very different in his contribution to nuclear weapons. There he contributed very down to earth things."

"Let me tell you one more thing -- that I always was full of admiration for Johnny, that I liked him very much, and I was sorry that, on the whole, his life was not entirely happy. His marriages were not really as successful as they should have been."

-- Eugene Wigner, 1987 Interview with Aspray

"During this time von Neumann was extremely interested in how we were getting along. He came here, I forget how frequently, but enough to give us talks on shock waves and hydrodynamics and in general, very nice lectures of his."

"Well, I would say, so far as the general appreciation of physics is concerned, and the regions of pressure, and temperature and so on that we had to deal with at molecular speeds, it certainly made a lot clearer why they existed, and what the limits were and that sort of thing. It certainly helped very much. Then, as you know, that grew to be a major part of the laboratory's effort. By August 1944, there was a reorganization of the laboratory, which split the work up. The explosive work was separated from what we called the gadget work, and initiator work, and things of that sort. So I would say that he was very instrumental in initiating serious attention to the idea, and he was instrumental in helping us do our work."

-- Charles Critchfield, 1987 Interview with Aspray

"Robert took him around and introduced him to a lot of people. Of course, his reputation preceded him."

"Each time it was always a very intense kind of interaction. His time was somewhat limited, and yet he was able to discuss a problem in a thorough manner. He was that kind of a person."

"In scientific discussions he was always very precise, very formal, and very clear in his exposition -- both while he was just having a discussion as well as when he would give a talk. He gave talks frequently, because he always came with such a wealth of information, owing to the fact that he was involved in so many different things."

"I think that von Neumann was extremely fair and very careful about the remarks that he made about anything and anybody."

"Von Neumann was very quick in seeing all of the implications of a really good idea. He could just run through, like no one else could, the consequences that might ensue from any new idea."

"As you know, one of the characteristics of von Neumann was that for the crystallization of his thinking, he would write things down. As a consequence, this characteristic enabled other people to have some formal report available to read and reflect on. I think it was this characteristic that enabled the thrust of von Neumann's impact on the program."

ASPRAY: Were the contributions that he made, for example in his written reports, essentially ones in helping to translate the physical problem into mathematics, or taking the stated problem of mathematics into numerical solution, or what else?

METROPOLIS: Well, I think both. You know, he knew a lot of physics.

"Von Neumann was very much interested in those subroutines that would be useful in implementing Monte Carlo, where from a uniform distribution of numbers you could get some other appropriate distribution. He was very much interested in just this question. He got many of us enthused about it. We would try to work out routines that would be efficient. One of the very first problems was how does one get a set of uniform distribution for the real numbers in any interval. That's when von Neumann came up with his suggestion of taking some big number, squaring it and extracting the middle digits from it and using that as the next iterate. When you exhausted those digits, you would just square that number and extract its middle. That turned out to be a subject that had a number of theoretical interests. We explored some of those things at that time as well as later"

"He would come frequently, but he never stayed very long. But whenever he did come, even for those short periods, he had a tremendous impact."

"He was certainly very much respected by Oppenheimer. And obviously so by Edward Teller. I'm sure Hans Bethe would have viewed him as a tremendous asset to the laboratory. There is a little anecdotal version of Fermi's interaction with von Neumann. I'm sure that they had many discussions together about various things."

"But, at any rate, when Fermi got back he called in Herb Anderson to his office and he said, "You know, Herb, how much faster I am in thinking than you are. That is how much faster von Neumann is compared to me."

-- Nicolas Metropolis, 1987 Interview with Aspray

"Yes. There were many different interests that Johnny had here, and he viewed them as unified. One of the interests was in a powerful computer to do numerical mathematics, or computational mathematics. And he saw, as clearly as anyone, and more clearly than most, that with these new, fast, large-capacity electronic computers, one could solve many problems numerically that hadn't been solved before. He had a practical interest in seeing that the problems were solved, but more than that, he thought that by solving special cases, one could get insight into how physical processes worked. In particular, he was interested in the problems of shock waves and when turbulence arose; problems that today we would talk about as chaotic behavior problems -- the solving of nonlinear partial differential equations. And it was clear from what he was saying that he thought that with powerful computers one could solve particular cases and use those as a heuristic guide to constructing theories and testing theories, so that experimental computations could play a role something like empirical experimentation could play in science. So that was a computational interest. As a logician, he was interested in the architecture of the computer and the design of programming languages that would be suitable for a computer. He was also interested (and this interest he got through the meetings he had with Wiener and others) on the... how was it natural systems computed. And he thought that there would be a theory of automata that would embrace both artificial devices and natural devices that computed, that would explain certain features of information handling in natural systems, and the nature of evolution, and things like that. And that knowledge of this generalized automata theory would be useful in designing more powerful computers, and in using more powerful computers."

"Yes, I had felt from a few interactions I had had that his colleagues thought that von Neumann was not using his creative mathematical skills properly in being involved in computers."

-- Arthur Burks, 1987 Interview with Aspray

"We had this problem of rationalizing it, and if I remember correctly, the first contact that I had with von Neumann was in one, at least, and possibly more -- it seems to me there were two or three -- discussions we had with him with regard to how these things could be rationalized and what we might do."

"But I was a man of courage, or whatever. So, when it came to having a meeting with von Neumann, I was willing to be chair of these meetings. [laugh] You know, I had enormous difficulty communicating between my level of intelligence and his."

"And Cuthbert Hurd was the one who arranged the meetings. He would arrange the meetings, and then the word would go out from the head of the laboratory who would say, "Von Neumann is going to be up next Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 and who is going to conduct the meeting?" You know, that sort of thing."

"Really, to be quite honest with the thing, the impression I have now, and the impression, if I remember correctly, that I had then was that the IBM Corporation felt this enormous debt to von Neumann for what he had contributed. It was very well recognized, this enormous debt to him. He had created the foundation of everything that we were doing. We saw all of this very, very clearly. And the corporation wanted to compensate him, at least in some small way, for this.  And hopefully, something would come out of it. But if something didn't come out of it, nobody cared because we owed him enough of a debt. We were in his debt no matter what happened."

"Of course, von Neumann's answer on those things was, well, you reformulate the problem a little bit, and everything will be all right. I might say this of von Neumann, that he had this enormous ability to do mental computation. While the rest of us poor souls would be sitting around discussing whether something could be done, he'd be sitting there quietly and come out and say, "It won't work. It won't work because this parameter isn't sufficiently well controlled," where he went through it in his head. He was that kind of person. So, what I wanted to say was, for the rest of us souls, we were all moving to a new intellectual plateau level as a result of electronic computers. They were exposing all sorts of problems. He was very busy contributing to these things, advising the various organizations on how the problems that existed could be formulated in a way that a computer would handle them. For that he was enormously valuable. When it came to the level of language problems that we had, he was not very helpful or very sympathetic. He insisted that only a few thousand words of memory was all you needed for any problem; and if you couldn't put it in that space, there's something wrong not with problem, but with you. You're the problem. That was his view of the thing. While we knew there that there was some truth in that, we also knew there wasn't some truth. But he went to his grave believing that sort of thing. I know he would say, "Just get smarter people. What's your problem? Get some smarter people in here.""

ASPRAY: What was his attitude about this commercial versus scientific line? Do you recall?

DUNWELL: I don't think he ever understood it. I don't think he ever saw any problem. I don't think that any problem was visible to him at all. The level at which he approached these things didn't permit considering the problems of some very ordinary people dealing with things. Anybody who couldn't compute in binary as easily as they could compute in decimal to him was the wrong person to be dealing with.

ASPRAY: Did he have any business acumen about these issues?

DUNWELL: Not that I ever saw. I really think that it became a problem really of two things: one, of putting things in a context in which people related to them. The people that used them related them to the things they knew and did. That was a part of it, and a very important part. Then, we had some things we had to learn about design so that these things seemed natural to people. But it was not his milieu. I think if he were alive today he wouldn't be interested. It isn't a question of his not being able to understand. To him, it would be the kind of trivia which should be better left to lesser people.

ASPRAY: It was quite clear this was a fundamentally a scientific instrument to him, and he was interested in only those problems.

DUNWELL: Yes, I think that's right.

"So, at that point Cuthbert took the matter to von Neumann and said, "This is what we want to do." Von Neumann was a commissioner. And he was the commissioner who had the responsibility for computing. He was the computing commissioner. His word was the final word. If he thought something ought to be done by the AEC in computing, the rest of them took his word for it. They left it to him, with good reason. So we presented the plan to von Neumann. He never went through the whole thing in all its dirty details. But we were asked to go out and present it at Los Alamos and so we did that."

"In all respects he appeared to be a very likeable person, and he was not a distant person. As I saw him, he was not a distant person, although those of us where our contacts were professional, we were a little bit sometimes put off by the difficulties of communicating at our level with him at his level. That was always a little bit of a problem. But he was always friendly and always bent over backwards to listen. He would never put you down, but he might not understand at all why you considered something a problem (laugh)."

"His intellectual contribution was at a level which was in keeping with his intellect. And it was enormous. You know, everything depended on that. But the kinds of remaining problems we had really descended essentially to what he might have thought of as trivia; you know, of writing a computer program to program a computer, for example -- things like that. Or how languages should be constructed so to make it easier for somebody to grasp what was going on. That didn't trouble him at all, because it wasn't a problem (laugh). It was a non-problem. So, I wish I could say more, and I wish there were more that I knew, but there isn't. I don't think you're going to find much in the way of digging unless you will find someone at one of these conferences who was very much influenced by von Neumann. For example, I don't know about floating points. I think the question of floating points is very interesting. I wouldn't be at all sure that von Neumann had very much interest in that."

-- Stephen Dunwell, 1989 Interview with Aspray

"I have always told people that the story of my introduction to computing was a very auspicious one: a series of three days' worth of seminars by John von Neumann at the University of Chicago in 1948 or thereabouts, better than which it was hard to do. And that just changed my thinking about almost everything. That was good enough for fifteen years or so -- whatever it is"

-- Charles Herzfeld, 1990 Interview with Norberg

"But von Neumann was always looking for ways and certainly one of his great contributions was his general scientific and mathematical contributions, along with the fact that he was a good promoter. And Tom Watson in his book, he doesn't quite get the story straight sequentially, but I know that when I told him that I wanted to hire von Neumann as a consultant, he knew von Neumann's name."

"In some way or another it meant a lot to Tom that von Neumann put his stamp of approval on the 701, the Defense Calculator. I can't remember how that happened, whether I brought von Neumann up to Tom's office and he met him and that's when he asked him, I don't remember the details, but I know that it was important to Tom because Tom was leading the company off into a new direction when frankly many at IBM were very happy with what they were doing. He took a tremendous risk, really."

"But no question that von Neumann was a strong influence even though he did not yet have a consulting agreement."

-- Cuthbert Hurd, 1994 Interview with Seidel

"The AEC soon made efforts to reconcile the scientific community. Perhaps most important was the appointment of John Von Neumann, the noted mathematician, as a second scientific member of the Commission. He was universally respected, by the friends of Oppenheimer as well as those of Teller."

-- Hans Bethe, Biographical Memoir on J. Robert Oppenheimer for the NAS

"Well, the credit should really go to three individuals. One is von Neumann, because his leadership of the Committee brought together this unusually strong scientific executive combination. It is not easy to call up people who are busy and important and tell them "We have still another committee for you to work on, but this time you do not just show up to a meeting once every 2 or 3 months and listen and make a comment, this time you are going to have to attend quite a number of meetings." John von Neumann was the kind of a person who could bring these people together."

"John von Neumann was the man with the greatest gift for words also. And I would say there are more words of his in that report than of any other person. The rest of us would struggle for a suggestion of a sentence, and if any of you have tried to write a document with a committee of 12 people, in which you suggest words, why, you know what I mean. We struggled with thought, and it would be von Neumann who would get out the thought clearly, in very simple and direct language. This was one of his special gifts."

-- Simon Ramo, Organization and Management of Missile Programs, 1959

"At the time, owing to the emigration of a small number of outstanding mathematicians such as Hille, Ore, E. Hopf, Τ. Rado, D. J. Struik, A. Wintner, and especially von Neumann, our country had already begun to achieve a mathematical strength commensurate with its population and resources.

Von Neumann was active and brilliant both at Aberdeen and Los Alamos, where he worked with such later emigres from Europe as Bethe, Fermi, and Teller, on the design of our first atomic bomb. He early recognized the potentialities of general purpose digital computers, and his contributions to their design during the decade 1943-53 may well rank as his most important work"

-- Garrett Birkhoff, Some Leaders in American Mathematics: 1891-1941

"V. Neumann was a key figure in the transition from pre-war to post-war mathematics.

However, no mere list of v. Neumann's achievements gives a proper picture of the man; for those who are too young to have glimpsed him I offer the image of Gelfand and Michael Atiyah rolled into one, with a couple of physicists and economists added for good measure. He carried thinking farther than most people can conceive of its being carried. That is the reason he was so much sought after by the government for advice. In an interview a few years ago on Hungarian television, Eugene Wigner was asked if it were true that the U.S. Government reached many scientific decisions by simply asking v. Neumann for his opinion. Wigner in his characteristic precise manner said, "Well, that is not exactly so; but once von Neumann analyzed a problem, it was clear what was to be done."

Not only the government but many mathematicians sought v. Neumann's advice about their research. Not that v. Neumann was able to solve a dif- ficult problem in a single interview, but he had an uncanny ability of relating it to other problems. Often such a reformulation represented the labor of six months of the person who posed the question.

In spite of his superhuman ability for analysis, v. Neumann was not always right; e.g., he was against floating point arithmetic and against large core memory for computers. But his influence on the whole was overwhelmingly good and his premature death robbed applied mathematics and computer science of a natural leader, a spokesman and a bridge to other sciences."

-- Peter D. Lax, The Bomb, Sputnik, Computers, and European Mathematicians

"In contrast to Bethe, John von Neumann very quickly realized the importance of reliability in the design of computers. It is no exaggeration to say that von Neumann had some familiarity (in the 1950s) with all the major ideas that have since proved crucial in the development of supercomputers."

-- N. Metropolis, The Age of Computing: A Personal Memoir

"People often mention the work of von Neumann at Los Alamos as evidence that a mathematician can do good physics, but when von Neumann visited Los Alamos, he functioned as a physicist. He was a first-rate physicist. He knew quantum mechanics, atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, relativity, and physical and organic chemistry. When he did physics, he thought, argued, and calculated like a physicist (but faster). Any mathematician that doesn't have von Neumann's talent should avoid the mistake of thinking things ought to be easy in physical science."

-- R. D. Richtmyer, On Pure and Applied Mathematics

"He and J. von Neumann are now universally acknowledged to be the two outstanding men of genius of the computer revolution"

-- J. H. Wilkinson, Turing's Work at the National Physical Laboratory and the Construction of Pilot ACE, DEUCE, and ACE

"Writing about computer development some 30 years ago at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) is a bit like returning to the scene of an early love affair. It revives deep feelings of involvement still for me, and I am sure also for all who took part. A long chain of improbable chance events led to our involvement; people ordinarily of modest aspirations, we all worked so hard and selflessly because we believed—we knew—it was happening here and at a few other places right then, and we were lucky to be in on it. We were sure because von Neumann cleared the cobwebs from our minds as nobody else could have done. A tidal wave of computational power was about to break and innundate everything in science and much elsewhere, and things would never be the same afterward. It would cleanse and solve areas of obscurity and debate that had piled up for decades. Those who really understood what they were trying to do would be able to express their ideas as coded instructions, calculate with powerful machines, and find answers and demonstrate explicitly by numerical experiments. The process would advance and solidify knowledge and tend to keep men honest.

Another anxiety about the arrangements also proved groundless; this was that since it was obvious to all of us that von Neumann was more clever than anybody and often twice as impatient, he might want to design and build the actual machine, or if not, to approve or disapprove techniques of its realization."

-- Julian Bigelow, Computer Development at the Institute for Advanced Study

"My choice fell immediately on the von Neumann group at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, not because I had seen anything of the hardware of their project, which I had not, but because the rigorous logic and precise thought of von Neumann attracted me: it had none of the airy imprecision of some of the other workers."

-- Andrew D. Booth, Computers in the University of London, 1945-1962

"Johnny von Neumann was so valuable, not only as a mathematician but in virtually every field, that he was welcome to work with us even for very short periods. He was allowed to come and go freely.

The person I was always happiest to see and work with at Los Alamos was my friend Johnny von Neumann. Johnny was the most versatile and brilliant scientist I have ever known. His mind operated at speeds that suggested neural superconductivity.

I do not want to disagree with Carson, but I think he exaggerates. I was
never, even in those circumstances, Johnny von Neumann's equal.

Johnny von Neumann worked on and made outstanding contributions to
the fields of mathematics, physics, economics, and history, and to the 
development of atomic bombs and computers. Johnny's motive was straightforward: He used his brain for the sheer pleasure of exercising it. He thoroughly enjoyed many aspects of life, but his deepest joy lay in intellectual activity.

I cannot remember what we discussed that day, but the subjects Johnny 
enjoyed ranged from history to weather prediction to game theory. Johnny was interested in any topic that offered him a chance of seeing a new relationship.

That deep, practically monomaniacal devotion to the thinking process is
what set Johnny von Neumann apart from everyone else I have ever known.
He was a mathematician, mathematics being the purest form of verifiable,
precise thought. Man apparently may become addicted to anything—even to
constructive, ingenious thinking. I believe that if a mentally superhuman
race ever develops, its members will resemble Johnny von Neumann."

-- Edward Teller, Memoirs: A Twentieth-Century Journal in Science and Politics

"TO SPECIALIZE is to restrict the scope of human interest. Such restriction is painful, but is considered necessary for the highest achievements. Some exceptionally gifted individuals are exempt from this rule. They can be creative in the highest sense of the word without becoming narrow. John von Neumann was one of these few individuals.

John Von Neumann's mathematics was most pure and new, but to many of us who had the privilege of working with him, it was even more important that he could adapt himself to any interesting line of reasoning.

This incredibly fruitful activity was possible to John Von Neumann because of his speed and adaptability. I often worked with him and never could keep up with him. I still wonder how much of his great abilities were due to what a person would call a gift and how much of it was training; but I suspect that it was due to an early discovery of the joy of thinking and an almost perpetual exercise of this activity."

-- Edward Teller, John von Neumann

"Von Neumann, probably the greatest mathematician of the century, periodically visited Los Alamos to apply his calculational skills to the project. Von Neumann was, according to Teller, "a mathematician who could descend to the level of a physicist."

“Johnny,” as all his friends called him, was the only scientist of the era to whom the word “genius” was almost universally applied. He had an uncanny ability to handle complex mathematical calculations in seconds.

According to Teller, the scientists used to say that it was possible to make two independent and true statements about Johnny von Neumann: (a) Johnny can prove anything, and (b) anything Johnny proves is correct.

The most fruitful of the exercises in indoctrination was that of Johnny von Neumann. He occupied a rather peculiar position, being the only scientist who visited Los Alarhos frequently and who had complete access to everything we were doing. Others who had similar privileges like, for instance, Drs. Tolman and Conant, exercised a Supervisory activity and did not contribute."

-- Stanley A. Blumberg and Gwen Owens, Energy & Conflict: The Life and Times of Edward Teller

"In the evening we occasionally played poker at the Staubs' house. We played in a very amateurish unsophisticated way. Sometimes John von Neumann joined us. I do not remember that he won particularly often, but he knew the odds of every card combination and of every move."

"John Von Neumann, a frequent visitor whose opinions always carried very great weight, favored a high-priority program for the development of the super.

John Von Neumann died in 1957 at age fifty-three after a very brief but spectacularly influential career as a top-level advisor in the Defense Department and as a member of the AEC."

-- Herbert F. York, The Advisors

"One other aspect which I should have mentioned in connection with the first two elements was the von Neumann Committee, which continued to be the advisory committee to the ICBM program. These people provided all the credibility for the program in terms of dealing with the outside world.They had credibility in the Pentagon, with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the scientific community. I don't think the program could have really been accomplished without the von Neumann Committee being part of the total structure.

The system stayed in effect until von Neumann died and Clark [B.] Millikan took over as chairman of that committee."

-- Bernard Schriever, Reflections On Research and Development in the United States Air Force

"Given these opportunities, Schriever’s technically sound and politically as- tute efforts led to success. He made the most of the situation and was the right man at the right time. As he noted much later, the foundation for his later success was his belief that physical scientists like Theodore von Kármán and John von Neumann had the intelligence and foresight to peer into and shape the future. He believed that these scientists had greater vision than his military contemporaries and that he would be on sound footing if he took them seriously."

-- Stephen B. Johnson, The United States Air Force and the Culture of Innovation 1945-1965

"Von Neumann in particular is representative of three distinct human features of the early postwar thermonuclear project: First, nuclear weapons scientists’ gradual recognition of computing as a critical problem to thoroughly understanding how -- and, more importantly, if -- the Super configuration would work; second, scientists’ quest for computational technology not only as a means of conducting difficult calculations that could not be solved analytically, but also for machines to make up for a lack of humans to do this work; third, and last, scientists created personal networks extending between Los Alamos and universities, corporate and military computing centers, and other government agencies.

While Dana Mitchell’s wartime connection to Eckert’s laboratory signaled the beginning of Los Alamos’s ties to large computing centers, von Neumann by far was the most influential in arranging for his colleagues to use the new electronic computers in such places as Philadelphia and New York, and in forging a permanent relationship between nuclear weapons science and computing."

-- Anne Fitzpatrick, Igniting The Light Elements: The Los Alamos Thermonuclear Weapon Project 1942-1952

"The Von Neumann Committee was remarkable in style as well as output. In its earliest meetings, the committee directly and intimately with Assistant Secretary of Defense Donald Quarles, Air Force Brigadier General Bernard A. Schriever, and Trevor Gardner, Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development. It was instrumental in establishing the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in its role of what is now called the "general systems engineering and technical direction" (GSETD) of all Air Force long-range-missile programs. It also established the basic design parameters for all the large rockets that the United States developed in the ensuring years.

This combination of scientific ability and practicality gave him a credibility with military officers, engineers, industrialists, and scientists that no one else could match. He was the clearly dominant advisory figure in nuclear missilery at the time, and everyone took his statements about what could and should be done very seriously."

"In Goettingen "I got to be quite a friend with [John] von Neumann.... He had a mind which was in some ways not like any I have ever known.... (Quote of J. Robert Oppenheimer)."

-- Abraham Pais, Robert P. Crease, J. Robert Oppenheimer: A Life

"I did become good friends with another mathematics professor, John von Neumann, however. In my life I have met men even greater than Johnny, but none as brilliant. He shone not only in mathematics but was also fluently multilingual and particularly well versed in history. He also could recite a huge collection of limericks, and taught me the only one in French I have ever heard.

Von Neumann was one of the rare mathematicians with whom I could talk physics. We physicists use mathematics as a tool and treat it with respect but not always with the same rigor that mathematicians do. As is well known in my profession, this often makes an exchange of views with math- ematicians difficult if not impossible—but not with Johnny. Which ex- plains, incidentally, why during the war he had been such a highly valued consultant at the Los Alamos atomic bomb laboratory. It was said that the Pentagon considered him as important as a whole army division.
I once came to him with a mathematics problem that had arisen in my own work and which I could not solve. He listened, then said he did not know the answer either but would think about it. Two weeks later (by that time I had figured it out by myself) I received an eight-page letter from him, posted in Los Alamos, in which he gave the solution."

-- Abraham Pais, A Tale of Two Continents

"Gardner had first to choose the right scientist as chairman, one not connected with any industrial company interested in contracts. I suggested several names, reserving the highest recommendation for John von Neumann. Von Neumann, educated broadly in science, was a mathematician whose contributions were so remarkable that he was often compared to Einstein, the latter considered the physicist, and von Neumann the mathematician, of the century.

Moreover, von Neumann was extremely articulate and unusually amiable and considerate, exhibiting easy maturity in his relationships with others despite being described by co-workers as the most “cerebrally dazzling” thinker they had ever met. He would be a wise leader for a panel of distinguished scientists and engineers consisting of world experts in their fields. Von Neumann would be sound and judicious, able to put the pieces together. He would be trusted.

John von Neumann’s availability to the ICBM program in late 1953 is a prime example. By 1954, not only was he chairing the Gardner task force (renamed the von Neumann Committee and made the official advisory committee for the ICBM program), but he took a leave from academic life and accepted an appointment to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). All nuclear matters in the 1950s were under the control of the AEC, which had five full-time commissioners. Traditionally, one of the commissioners was a recognized statesman-scientist, and von Neumann filled that role. As such, he was able to ensure that the AEC would give top support to the ICBM program, with warheads tailored to fit the program’s needs. 

During the last year of his life, a phone call about the project from Dr. von Neumann to people within and outside government was highly influential in eliminating bottlenecks. I know that the others, like me, felt an immense desire to prove out our ICBM design before von Neumann’s death."

-- Simon Ramo, The Business of Science: Winning and Losing in the High-Tech Age

"How was it? Scary. The most spectacular thing about Johnny was not his power as a mathematician, whieh was great, or his insight and his clarity, but his rapidity; he was very, very fast. And like the modern computer, which no longer bothers to retrieve the logarithm of 11 from its memory (but, instead, computes the logarithm of 11 each time it is needed), Johnny didn't bother to remember things. He computed them. You asked him a question, and if he didn't know the answer, he thought for three seconds and would produce the answer.

And as I said before, his speed, plus depth, plus insight, plus inspiration turned me on. They - Doob and von Neumann - were my two greatest inspirations."

"MP: Von Neumann apparently made a strong impression on anyone he came in contact with.

DANTZIG: Yes, people would come to him because of his great insight. In the initial stages of the development of a new field like linear programming, atomic physics, computers or whatever, his advice proved invaluable. After these fields were developed in greater depth, however, it became increasingly more difficult for him to make the same spectacular contributions. I guess everyone has a finite capacity, and Johnny was no exception.

KAPLANSKY: There we were at Chicago, lucky enough to have Andre Weil, one of the greatest mathematicians in the world. There were several times in my life that I’ve, one way or another, got that feeling, my gosh, here is a tremendous mathematician; for instance, Weil, von Neumann, Serre, Milnor, Atiyah. Well, those are obvious names.

LAX: Von Neumann, who was the central figure of the mid-century, firmly believed that computing was central not only to the numerical side of applied mathematics but also to progress in theory. That is why he invented computers and pushed for their development. He foresaw that computations are essential to discover basic phenomena in nonlinear systems."

-- Donald J. Alberts, Gerald L. Alexanderson, Constance Reid, More Mathematical People

"Erdōs: Von Neumann was very impressive to talk with. He was very quick, but I don’t know his work that much.

In speed and understanding Von Neumann was certainly phenomenal. He could understand a proof even far from his own subject very fast. I remember once in Cambridge I told him a proof of interpolation that was not quite correct. By the time we met again I had a correct proof. Von Neumann told me, “Something seems to be wrong in that proof.” And it was really not his subject. He wasn’t that interested in it, but he was quite right.

Kemedy: Then I met two people who changed my mind completely, and I met them fairly close to one another. One was von Neumann, certainly the greatest mathematician of that time, and he was not peculiar at all. The other was Einstein.

Reid: Certainly not if he had had a von Neumann competing against him! All the mathematicians I have talked to have said that von Neumann had the quickest mind they ever knew."

"One afternoon around 4:50 p.m., John von Neumann came by and saw what Fermi had on the blackboard and asked what he was doing. So Enrico told him and John von Neumann said "That's very interesting." He came back about 15 minutes later and showed him how to approach the problem. Fermi leaned against his doorpost and told me, "You know that man makes me feel I know no mathematics at all.""

"Nevertheless, it was generally agreed that von Neumann was the leading mathematical mind in the world at that time."

-- Alice Beckenbach, Fascinating Mathematical People: Interviews and Memoirs

"Fermi did not have any specific scientific duty nor was he assigned any particular administrative responsibility; he was on the governing board of the laboratory with which the director consulted on all important matters, but otherwise he was a sort of oracle whose job was to solve problems above the ordinary capabilities of the staff, distinguished as it was. J. von Neumann, as a consultant, had a somewhat similar job.

I remember having listened in his office to discussions on hydrodynamics with von Neumann. They took the strange form of a competition in front of a blackboard to see who could first solve the problem; von Neumann, using his insuperable lightning analytical skill, usually won."

"Enrico reported on a recent trip to Los Alamos, where he collaborated with the Hungarian mathematician and computer master Johnny von Neumann on some undisclosed problem, As Enrico reported, Johnny was calling on obscure changes of variables, unheard-of transforms, and, for all I remember, the Heimlich maneuver, in a tour de force solution of the problem, completed in jig time. Enrico turned to us with a quizzical look on his face and said, “You know, I felt like the fly who sits on the plow and says, ‘We are plowing.’” Wreathed in smiles, we all fell off our chairs."

-- Courtenay Wright, Fermi Remembered

"One Friday night Herb Anderson was treating our graduate student group to
 dinner, but Herb showed up at the restaurant quite late. In making his apology, Herb (who was then directing the Institute for Nuclear Studies) told us that he had been waiting to consult with Enrico but had not wanted to interrupt the discussion Enrico was having with that day’s guest, John von Neumann. Herb recounted that when he finally saw Enrico, Fermi started off by saying how impressive von Neumann was: “You know, Herb, Johnny can do calculations in his head ten times as fast as I can!”

Enrico continued, with some humor, “And I can do them ten times as fast as you can Herb, so you can see how impressive Johnny is!” Since Herb was no slouch at figuring things in his head, we were properly impressed."

-- Maurice Glicksman

"So he did some of that but he wasn't quite satisfied with the solution. One afternoon around 4:50 p.m., John von Neumann came by and saw what Fermi had on the blackboard and asked what he was doing. So Enrico told him and John von Neumann said "That's very interesting." He came back about 15 minutes later and showed him how to approach the problem. Fermi leaned against his doorpost and told me, "You know that man makes me feel I know no mathematics at all."

-- Richard L. Darwin, Working with Fermi at Chicago and Los Alamos

"Von Neumann is regarded by many as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. Born in Budapest, he went to high school with the other Los Alamos Hungarians, Szilard, Teller, and Wigner. They all considered him the smartest of the bunch.

Fermi quickly recognized the Hungarian’s superior mathematical ability but always tried to outdo von Neumann when it came to calculating. He rarely succeeded. Bethe, Fermi, and von Neumann could often be found sitting together in a quiet room inside the throbbing heart of the Theoretical Division, challenging each other to solve complex integral equations related to pressure waves. Sometimes Oppenheimer would join them. Von Neumann usually left these other three brilliant physicists in the dust."

-- David N. Schwartz, The Last Man Who Knew Everything

"Three came to the United States in 1930: the mathematician John Von Neumann, the only Hungarian of his generation to be recognized as a genius by his countrymen (at least by all with whom I spoke).

To Eugene Wigner I must have asked the question too emphatically and mentioned genius rather than talent, for he answered that the question did not make sense. In his generation, he said, Hungary had not produced more geniuses than other countries; actually, she had produced only one: John Von Neumann.

Fubini attained one of the two highest positions in government reached by émigré intellectuals: in 1963 he was appointed Assistant Secretary of Defense and Deputy Director of Defense Research. (The other high position was John Von Neumann’s as a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission.)

Not only was he the “most normal” of Hungarian scientists, in the opinion of his non-Hungarian friends, but he was also one of the very few men about whom I have not heard a single critical remark. It is astonishing that so much equanimity and so much intelligence could be concentrated in a man of no extraordinary appearance, short, with a round face and a round body. His qualities of genius include a prodigious mental speed and an enormous depth and adaptability of thought.

Because of the forceful action of Von Neumann and his committee, Bethe said, the United States had the missiles only a matter of months after the Soviet Union; otherwise there would have been a lag of several years.

While mathematics tends to abstract itself from reality, Von Neumann was always sensitive and responsive to current human problems."

-- Laura Fermi, Illustrious Immigrants

"This work of the theoretical section involved not only nuclear problems but also very advanced hydrodynamics, to which Sir Geoffrey Taylor, the famous British applied mathematician, and von Neumann brought incomparable expertise.

I remember having listened to Fermi’s discussions on hydrodynamics with von Neumann. (These took the strange form of competitions before Fermi’s office blackboard as each tried to solve the problem under study first; von Neumann, with his unmatched lightning-fast analytical skill, usually won).

Von Neumann was the other oracle of the laboratory. A distinguished experimental physicist and I had struggled unsuccessfully for an afternoon on a problem that hinged on an integral when, through our open door, we saw von Neumann walking down the corridor toward our office. The integral that baffled us was written on the blackboard. We asked von Neumann, “Can you help us with this integral?” He came to the door, glanced at the blackboard, and dictated the answer. We were absolutely dumbfounded and asked ourselves how he did it. I am sure that similar examples could be quoted by the dozen."

-- Emilio Segrè, Enrico Fermi: Physicist

"Dr. von Neumann is one of the great mathematicians of this generation and has achieved world renown. He has made fundamental contributions to theoretical physics. In the field of probability and theoretical economics he has done fundamental work which has won wide attention and attracted many disciples.

Our recommendation for this Award however rests primarily on the contributions of Dr. von Neumann to the art and science of the design and application of fast electronic calculating machines. Many scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have contributed to this field which is now one of the great achievements of the present generation and is still developing with great rapidity.

In this development Dr. von Neumann has played a leading role as teacher, inspirer, and original contributor to the profound problems of the logic of programming for the most effective use of these expensive and elaborate devices. He was foremost amongst those who foresaw the importance and indeed the necessity for these fast computing machines in the development and design of the devices which are fundamental to the use and control of atomic energy.

These machines have in fact been of the greatest utility especially in the design of nuclear weapons. They are now being increasingly employed in the design of power reactors. Some of the most important advances and insights in this field would have been impossible to achieve in a reasonable time and as successfully without their aid.

One of the most important of these machines was constructed under Dr. von Neumann's direct supervision, and his influence, enthusiasm, and ideas gave direction to the whole development. It can safely be stated that without Dr. von Neumann's multiform contributions the whole development would have been greatly retarded. The fact that the use of these machines, all developed almost within a decade, is now commonplace in industry, in business, and in military, engineering, meteorological, and scientific applications is largely due to Dr. von Neumann's direct contributions and inspired direction. In the control and use of atomic energy for military or peaceful purposes, which was central in Dr. von Neumann's mind in the development of these machines, they are indispensable.

The remarks which stress a single but extremely important facet of Dr. von Neumann's many contributions should not make us forget the great but classified contributions which Dr. von Neumann made to the theory and design of both fission and thermonuclear weapons. However, it is our opinion that his contribution to the art and science of computation alone, as applied to the use and control of atomic energy, is more than ample justification for conferring the Fermi Award of 1956 on Dr. John von Neumann."

-- General Advisory Committee of the AEC, Upon von Neumann receiving the Fermi Award

"One day, in my first year as an assistant professor at MIT, while walking down one of the long corridors, I met Professor Z, a respected senior mathematician with a solid international reputation. He stared at me and shouted, “Admit it! All lattice theory is trivial!” I did not have the presence to answer that von Neumann’s work in lattice theory is deeper than anything Professor Z has done in mathematics.

Many of us remember the feeling of ecstasy we experienced when we first read von Neumann’s series of papers on rings of operators in Hilbert space. It is a paradise from which no one will ever dislodge us (as Hilbert said of Cantor's set theory). But von Neumann’s achievements went far beyond the reaches of pure mathematics. Together with Ulam, he was the first to have a vision of the boundless possibilities of computing, and he had the resolve to gather the considerable intellectual and engineering resources that led to the construction of the first large computer, the Maniac. No other mathematician in this century has had as deep and lasting an influence on the course of civilization.

Von Neumann had an incomparably stronger technique.

You are not the best mathematician I have ever met, because von Neumann was better."

-- Gian-Carlo Rota, Indiscrete Thoughts

"Poincare was one of the last universal minds of this sort. In more recent times, one could mention Herman Weyl and to some extent, John von Neumann. They contributed more than mere grammar to the science of physics; their points of view influenced the physical thinking itself.

Von Neumann, the man who in the words of physicist Freeman Dyson had "consciously and deliberately set mankind moving along the road that led us into the age of computers."

IN JOHN VON NEUMANN'S DEATH on February 8, 1957, the world of mathematics lost a most original, penetrating, and versatile mind. Science suffered the loss of a universal intellect and a unique interpreter of mathematics, who could bring the latest (and develop latent) applications of its methods to bear on problems of physics, astronomy, biology, and the new technology.

To follow chronologically von Neumann's interests and accomplishments is to review a large part of the whole scientific development of the last three decades.

In his constant search for applicability and in his general mathematical instinct for all exact sciences, he brought to mind Euler, Poincare, or in more recent times, perhaps Hermann Weyl. One should remember that the diversity and complexity of contemporary problems surpass enormously the situation confronting the first two named. In one of his last articles,

Johnny deplored the fact that it does not seem possible nowadays for anyone brain to have more than a passing knowledge of more than one-third of the field of pure mathematics."

-- Stanisław Ulam, Science, Computers, and People: From the Tree of Mathematics

"Haldane did not foresee the computer, the most potent agent of social change during the last fifty years. He expected his Daedalus, destroyer of gods and of men, to be a biologist. Instead, the Daedalus of this century turned out to be John von Neumann, the mathematician who consciously pushed mankind into the era of computers. Von Neumann knew well what he was doing. Soon after the end of the second world war, he started the Princeton computer project. Like Haldane's Daedalus, he had dreams that went far beyond the scientific instrument that he was building in Princeton. He spoke and wrote much about automata. His automata were abstract generalizations of a computer. An automaton was a machine that could not merely compute but carry out actions in the real world as instructed by its program. Von Neumann saw that there was no limit to the scale and complexity of actions that automata could perform. His computer was only a small step toward the realization of his dream of automata guided by artificial intelligence."

-- Freeman Dyson, Imagined Worlds

"But the branches that are healthy and thriving are still numerous, and their growth has produced a unique situation in the history of mathematics: the extinction of a species of universal mathematicians, that is, of those individuals of an exceptional culture who could thoroughly dominate the entire landscape of the mathematics of their time. The last specimen of such a species appears to have been John von Neumann, who died in 1957."

"There was a lively group of young meteorologists working on problem (2). Most of them came from Norway, which has always been a great country for meteorology since it has atrocious weather and depends on fishing to stay alive. I enjoyed talking with them and hearing their stories. They all had a great respect for Von Neumann.

If Von Neumann and Bronowski were running for president (what a delightful prospect that would be!), Bronowski would probably win, but I would vote for Von Neumann."

-- Freeman Dyson, Dear Professor Dyson

"Von Neumann was a great mathematician and had the reputation at that time of being the cleverest man in the world. He was supposed to be the intellectual force driving the whole development of computers. He was a great thinker and a great entrepreneur."

"The gap between physics and mathematics was as wide as the gap between science and the humanities described by C. P. Snow in his famous lecture on the Two Cultures. Johnny was one of the very few people who was at home in all four cultures, in physics and mathematics, and also in science and the humanities."

"Another fox who played an important part in twentieth-century science was John von Neumann. Von Neumann was interested in almost everything and made important contributions to many fields."

"Morgenstern was once asked how a scholar outside the mainstream of economic thinking could make a contribution as original, innovative, and decisive as Johnny’s. He replied that Johnny had an extraordinary capacity for picking the brains of a person whom he engaged in casual conversations. Once he saw from these that there was a problem of sufficient mathematical interest to warrant his spending time on it, he homed on to that subject like a guided missile.

It has been said of him that the Pentagon considered him as important as a whole army division.

In my life I have met men even greater than Johnny, but none as brilliant. He shone not only in mathematics but was also fluently multilingual and particularly well-versed in history. One of his most remarkable abilities I soon came to note was his power of absolute recall.

Von Neumann was one of the rare mathematicians with whom I could talk physics. We physicists use mathematics as a tool and treat it with respect but not always with the same rigor mathematicians do. As is well known in my profession, that often makes exchange of views with mathematicians difficult if not impossible—but not with Johnny. Which explains, incidentally, why during the war he had been such a highly valued consultant at the Los Alamos atomic bomb laboratory.

I cannot shake the idea that reserve on Oppenheimer’s side, caused by jealousy, may have contributed, since von Neumann was so much smarter than he.

Von Neumann’s reputation and fame have grown steadily since his death. His fantastic brain, and the breadth of his interests and undertakings, have become almost legendary."

-- Abraham Pais, The Genius of Science

"I am convinced that von Neumann would be a good man to try out. In my last conversation with Weyl, Weyl strongly recommended Neumann as his successor, so he has evidently made good with two of the chief men, Dirac and Weyl. I have had an eye on Neumann for three years or more, as being the best young man in Germany. I met him last summer at Bologna and we talked about the possibility of his coming over on an international fellowship. Later on he wrote me that he would not be able to do it because of having taken a special position of some sort at Hamburg. He is a Privatdozent at Berlin, but he is a Hungarian by birth. He makes a very good impression personally."

-- Oswald Veblen, Letter to Eisenhart

"Our convivial evenings had considerable educational value in their own right. For example, Von Neumann’s broad interests and eternal curiosity were always in evidence on these occasions. He was prepared to discuss any topic, whether related to the past, present, or future, dealing with science, technology, economics, or sociology. His insights were unfailingly keen; his detailed knowledge of history was awesome, and his discussions of economics were usually quantitative and enlightening. He would have been an outstanding figure in almost any field of intellectual endeavor. Because of his interest in electronic computers, he was excited by the announcement of the invention of the transistor. He undoubtedly saw it as a more reliable replacement for the vacuum tube, which was limited in frequency response and very wasteful of energy. Unfortunately, he did not live to see the age of the integrated circuit.

Von Neumann’s creative interest in electronic computers and the logic involved in their operation inspired a number of applied mathematicians to seek to work with him in his university setting. While all admired his magnificent mental gifts, those of his colleagues who were committed Marxists were puzzled by his strong dislike of Soviet communism; to them this was an illogical attitude to be held by an individual so comprehensively brilliant.

Von Neumann was rather annoyed at how quickly and efficiently construction had been completed at Illinois, because he had had a team working on the same task at Princeton since the end of the war, with less effective results. He took comfort, however, in observing, “You people may be first, but I am the only person who knows how to use these machines properly.” 

We enjoyed many visits from this remarkable genius, who clearly relished the opportunity to come and play with his brainchild. In the question period after one of his lectures, someone asked him if he thought we would eventually match the capabilities of the human brain with these machines. He grimaced and responded, “I am afraid that the brain shows the really professional touch.”

After Sputnik, the Pentagon determined that it should create twelve new laboratories devoted to materials science, in order to strengthen its position in the coming space age. Actually the concept of creating such government-sponsored materials laboratories had originated with John von Neumann during his period as Commissioner on the AEC, starting in 1954. He had decided that advances in such research were as important for both science and technology as any other; much more concentrated attention should be devoted to the field. In the process he elevated the field of research in materials science to a state of dignity and respect which it has continued to enjoy since. One of his first actions had been to ask me to prepare a proposal to the AEC for establishing such an interdisciplinary lab at the University of Illinois. I complied at once with the support of the University. He also urged other agencies of the government to follow this lead. His death from cancer early in 1957 derailed the initial proposal to the AEC, but the plan took root at the Department of Defense.

"Looking back across fifty years, Edward Teller described his return to
Chicago with great affection. It was to be the last substantial academic
interlude in his life and it was spent 'among friends from home'. He was
working closely with Maria Mayer, debating with Leo Szilard, and enjoying
a close personal and family friendship with the scientists he perhaps
admired most of all, Enrico Fermi and John von Neumann."

-- Peter Goodchild, Edward Teller: The real Dr. Strangelove

"Another frequent visitor was John von Neumann, a brilliant mathematician, whom I knew from Germany. Although he was Hungarian, he did not have the extreme superficial politeness of many Hungarians. He liked good living and a good story. His mathematics was of the purest and most abstract kind, but he also understood physics and had written a book about quantum mechanics. He was extremely fast in solving practical problems, and contributed many useful ideas to the work of Los Alamos."

-- Rudolph Peierls, Birds of Passage: Recollections of a Physicist

"Johnny von Neumann was so valuable, not only as a mathematician but in virtually every field, that he was welcome to work with us even for very short periods. He was allowed to come and go freely.

The person I was always happiest to see and work with at Los Alamos was
my friend Johnny von Neumann. Johnny was the most versatile and brilliant
scientist I have ever known. His mind operated at speeds that suggested 
neural superconductivity.

I do not want to disagree with Carson, but I think he exaggerates. I was
never, even in those circumstances, Johnny von Neumann's equal.

That deep, practically monomaniacal devotion to the thinking process is
what set Johnny von Neumann apart from everyone else I have ever known.
He was a mathematician, mathematics being the purest form of verifiable,
precise thought. Man apparently may become addicted to anything—even to
constructive, ingenious thinking. I believe that if a mentally superhuman
race ever develops, its members will resemble Johnny von Neumann."

-- John Dawson, Interview with Linda Arntzenius

"But the most interesting aspect of Von Neumann's collaboration with us was the fact that I saw something which we still have difficulty in accomplishing today and that was human interaction with the machine in quite an optimum way. The machine could only add at the rate of 3 of these 23 digit numbers per second and its multiplication was the order of four seconds, and with speeds of this sort to attempt to solve partial differential equations of these complexities was almost an impossibility, but not with Von Neumann's guidance, because we would put test parameters into the machine, work on a particular grid which was very coarse, and then when he suggested that I make a change in the program I acceded to this, although pointing out it would take a couple of hours to do. He pointed out that we might save two or three weeks of running time and that really it was quite important. I didn't realize how important at the time. And indeed, he was right, as he usually was. I think the attribute of using the computer as a tool rather than as a final authority, as a tool for a bright human to use, was the most outstanding feature of that experience."

-- Richard Bloch, In The Beginning, Reminiscences of the Creators

"We were very fortunate that Von Neumann was as a consultant to our contracts and when I first told him about his matrix, he said, "Gee whiz, this can't possibly work. It is just a monster short circuit. Everything is really connected to everything else." I must give all credit to Von Neumann because when I explained to him that we should make the impedances right, it really isn't a nonsense type of short circuit but a very meaningful type, he saw the thing immediately."

-- Jan Rajchmann, In The Beginning, Reminiscences of the Creators

"There were scientific advisory bodies for every governmental research group in the United States and in England, and von Neumann was the strongest catalyst of all of these—he belonged to all of them. And he was the greatest communicator of ideas about computing machines and about methods of using computing machines before, during, and after the formation of ACM. I think John played down his role. It may be true that he didn’t know anything about computers before 1945, but I think he doesn’t need any apologist. But nevertheless, I feel that it should be said that he saw more deeply into what they were all about than anybody else, and his incisive report written in 1945 describing the EDVAC was read by everybody, and had made a tremendous impression. And when I say everybody, I mean several hundreds of people all over the world, at least in the Untied States and England. There were others that, like Hartree in England, who had been doing important calculations for years before there were electronic computers, and who were just itching for a tool that would allow them to move ahead rapidly. So the interest was there. You commented that it didn’t seem as if the environment was right for the formation of such a society, but the lectures that had taken place at the University of Pennsylvania had been attended by people from many places around the world, and those had stimulated tremendous interest in the field of computers."

-- Unknown Male, Association for Computing Machinery, General Meeting August 14 1972

"I remember that somebody there and it might have been Garrett Burkhoff's eventual "von Neumann is", and somebody said, "yes, he was one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, but obviously, he was getting old." And I think that if there was one thing about which those mathematicians would have agreed, it was that. And if I'm not wrong, it was Marston Morse who said this, and he was a very able mathematician."

-- I. B. Cohen, Interview with Howard Aiken 1973

"And yet the concepts and the ideas and the reasons — he was very thorough in explaining why we needed a particular instruction or why we could do without an instruction or things of this kind. And it was the first time that I had ever realized the importance of instruction codes, I would say, and why they're important and the logic behind them and the ingredients that a whole instruction set must have. So the thing that Von Neumann had which I've noticed that other geniuses have, and that is the ability to pick out, in a particular problem, the one crucial thing that's important, or the one general principle that you are being hung up on, things of that kind. This, this is the kind of tale. he had. Yet he, he was very restless and he would march back and forth across the room, yet when he presented his ideas it was almost as though he were apologizing for ... disagreeing with you or thinking of a better idea."

-- Jean Bartik, Interview with Henry Tropp 1973

"I think it's important to mention that Von Neumann had been involved in many kind of computations during World War II. He was an extremely flexible and competent man in many different branches of scientific activity, ranging from physics through ballistic computation and other quasi engineering areas, all the way down to the actual engineering and design of various kinds of ordnance and physical apparatus for warfare. He was involved in many different kinds of military computations and military advisory functions during World War II.

One would have to change the statistics of reliability of the thing, or change its design, or partition it much smaller. Rajchman, though one of the most gifted people I have ever known, had a blind spot. He had an inability to understand this, to accept it or to believe it, as some of us pointed this out. Von Neumann, of course, understood it instantly, because his mind was faster than anybody's, and he saw things more clearly than most people of that era.

The person who really, however, pushed the whole field ahead, was Von Neumann, because he understood logically what it meant in a deeper way than anybody else. I think that's the correct statement of the situation, and a lot of people picked this up. A lot of people say: "Oh, I said, stored programmer", but Von Neumann really understood it in a very deeper way.

He stimulated people everywhere. Von Neumann was generous intellectually, because his resources were so enormous, that he never gave away anything that he couldn't do without. He was a fountainhead of information, and he didn't hold back because there was always much more in depth than he ever exposed at one time. I'm not exaggerating. This was indeed how he was. In the few decades that followed, I have had the experience of understanding what this was like, by working as a consultant for some groups who were at a technical level so far below what I knew myself, that what they felt was worth bickering about was in fact possible [?] that one could ignore it, because one knows one has much more in depth than that and that's not an important point. Let them bicker about it, or let them think that they did something great. He was precisely that way. He was in depth, more knowledgeable than any man, and I say this having worked with Wiener for four years, and Wiener was no slouch himself. Von Neumann was a giant. He was ahead of anybody.

It was one stage in a very long career. No, it's interesting that Von Neumann saw the importance and the power of this, but in some sense, there were certain areas which he did not see as well as one might have expected. For example, Von Neumann was never keenly aware of the importance of the program system side of the problem. The idea of a compiler, for example, never appeared to Von Neumann as an important thing. The idea that you needed a language in which you'd express, a Fortran language, did not occur to him early in the game. I remember because he was such a clever person, he could program the machine language rapidly and see things. He was very very gifted. He could solve problems in any set of symbols, write down a new set, and he would be able to substitute mentally what these new ones meant, and go right ahead. So that the question of intermediary languages and conversion processes, which has now become an enormous area, seemed to him a trivial question, and who wans to fool with that?

However, I think that even had Von Neumann lived, even though he were still alive, you had to fight every step of the way if you wanted to continue in that area. The only reason it ever got going, was because he was such a competent and respected figure, that they essentially couldn't say no. The Director at that time, Frank Aydelotte, was a humanist, who knew nothing about mathematics or any of that branch of science, but he knew a brain when he saw one, and he respected what Von Neumann wanted, and he sort of said: "Well, let's give the man what he wants."

Oh, yes. The reason he made Goldstine and me permanent members, was that he wanted to be sure that two or three people whose talent he respected would be around no matter what happened, for this effort. He talked to me many times of putting this together. He wanted biology, he wanted mathematical biology, he wanted mathematical astronomy, and he wanted earth sciences. He visualized the ability to do these computations as it has, as affecting these branches of science to a great degree, and as enormously expanding his personal abilities to get into and to contribute to all these different fields, which indeed, I think there is no doubt he could have done. It is a sad fact that he somehow became, in the last five years of his life, so involved in political questions, I think they essentially were, that it was very difficult for him to be able to refuse, because the gravest of responsibilities were offered to him. This was a greater tragedy than that he lost the machines. Von Neumann's aversion to doing things which [?].

His personality was also a very complex one, and as many people who are very gifted, he had compulsions here and there, and although he was quite wealthy, he was always attracted by making more money.

Von Neumann was a fantastic technician in mathematics, as well as being imaginative and insightful, and he was one of the few people who would really think out loud and prove a theorem on the blackboard, inventing notation and inventing procedures just as he went along. He really lived in this kind of a skill field, and he was so competent in it, that his invention occurred really in that milieu.

Wiener's interests were wide, but he loved to play sort of power intellectual games with the problem, whereas Von Neumann would see the point just like that and get to work, and then when that's disposed of, let's move on.

Von Neumann had enormous amounts of reserve, which he only gave forth when he felt like exerting himself. Then, he was one of the most lucid and precise people I've ever heard."

-- Julian Bigelow, Interview with Richard Mertz 1971

"His mind was really unusual and quite wondrous to watch. He just loved to do problems, to think, to do puzzles, he used to enjoy that. His thinking, of course, and his work had great depth to it. Most people who have great -- His thinking was very deep and incisive and normally one associates a person who thinks deeply with someone who thinks slowly and methodically and carefully in his own room, but that was not the case with von Neumann. He thought very quickly and had an uncanny ability to relate for instance one field to another. I'd like to give an example of that in just a moment. But he remembered most of the things that he knew so that when he read something--he very seldom used many books or any books, he just sat down at a desk, and in a little note wrote out all the equations that were necessary. To give that example as to how he related one field to another, we had a well-known astronomer working for us at that time during the War with that same group. His name was Keenan, K-E-E-N-A-N. He was working on an optical problem, which he couldn't solve for a number of weeks. There were some difficulties about which he just couldn't reach a conclusion. He asked various people and worked on it himself for a long time, and we suggested that he ask von Neumann. Of course he was a very shy man and hesitated to do that. Finally, after a long period of time he decided he will ask von Neumann. And von Neumann looked at the problem. It didn't take long, just a few minutes, and said "well, for goodness sakes, that same problem occurs in a different field, in the electromagnetic field."..Let's see, now, this is an entirely different field, ...which field -- and sat down and wrote out the difficulty, wrote out the equation, wrote out why there is difficulty, and explained what the difficulty was in just a matter of just about ten to fifteen, twenty minutes."

-- Harry Polachek, Interview with Richard Mertz 1970

"I had been associated with Von Neumann before the end of World War II in the whole area of the development of machines, and I relied pretty heavily on his advice about how to go in this area. I tried to get him to write something, but I never succeeded. Of course, a lot of other people tried to get him to write too, but didn't succeed. But after World War II when I went to the Office of Naval Research, Von Neumann was one of my prime advisers in general and, of course, in particular in the area of computing machinery. He made a practice whenever he got to Washington of stopping in to see me, and that was great. I counted on this opportunity to ask him about anything that I didn't understand, and there were many, many things I didn't understand about various areas of mathematics that people were interested in.

You and I were talking a little earlier about Von Neumann, and you said that Von Neumann communicated with people at their own level, and I had real experience within that. I would ask him if there was something in turbulence that I didn't understand, a question. Of course that's something nobody understood then. He would explain it all in his most fluent English and I would say, "Now wait a minute, Johnny. I don't understand that." So then he would step it down a level so that he was talking to me and not just in general. He did this with regard to anything that I queried him about.

There was just nothing significant going on that was not influenced by conversations with Von Neumann. Now whether he convinced the people he talked to or not I wouldn't be sure, but certainly nobody ignored him. I would think he played a very central role and, of course, in the outcome his ideas were heavily represented in the major developments."

-- Minas Rees, Interview with Henry Tropp, 1972

"Well, he was certainly one of the greatest people I've ever encountered. He had an incredible ability to take a, take a messy area and make it clear and simple. But he'd do this in a way that would be much more powerful than you would expect it to be possible. You wouldn't realize the generality that was possible that he would create in the design. One of the connections I had with [Von Neumann] was, he was very much concerned with how to program computers. And in, in the original series of three reports, the Burks, Von Neumann and Goldstine, there was a procedure for writing programs so that you could make corrections. There was essentially a clerical concept of how to assemble a program."

-- Nat Rochester, Interview with Henry Tropp, 1973

"It was a concession to Von Neumann even to allow it. That is correct. And it was done only because Von Neumann assured them that when the computer was done it was going to serve the mathematicians and physicists who had problems on nuclear physics to solve and problems in atomic energy which was what interested him. He was concerned with the quantum theory of particles in heterogeneous media with nonlinear boundary conditions, and that’s a mess even today to solve on a computer. And he was hoping to solve that problem.

As I mentioned earlier, he was a man with tremendous practical sense. As I say, sufficiently practical sense that he could recite dirty limericks by the score and really entertain an audience for hours, so he was a very human person, and that's part of the reason why he had very little time that he could grant people because ??? But I've heard it said by many people on many occasions, give me five minutes with Von Neumann and I'm willing to to get it, because I get my problems solved, I don't just get an audience. Julius or Julian up at Harvard had the same attribute. You could almost never get to see him but he was worth waiting a month for."

-- Morris Rubinoff, Interview with Richard Mertz 1971

"He thought that a very workable suggestion and asked who would be the best person on the country. I said, the best man in the country in computers was John von Neumann.

No. I think at one conference von Neumann gave a talk, Weiner gave a talk, and Shannon gave a talk in the very early days. I think I learned most from listening to von Neumann because he had the courage to make it very straightforward and simple. He used familiar analogies and explained the computer without any mathematics at all. The analogies he used were useful and thoughtful. Actually I learned more from Galileo and Aristotle, but I learned a good deal from von Neumann. I learned something from von Karman one time in just one day. I took a course under him and during a two-day period I learned a great lesson. What you really learn from these people is how you go about thinking, rather than the details of what you think. In other words, this is what you today learn from Galileo better than you learn at any university: how you go about thinking about a problem. This is why Aristotle is so good, even though some of his results aren’t so hot. He shows you how to sit down with nothing to go on at all, and begin to think accurately, rationally, precisely, neatly and with a slight sense of humor. I learned a lot just from listening to that paper by von Neumann because he was so lucid, so easy going. It was the fact that he appeared to go to some pains to look at another way of looking at things."

-- G. Floyd Steele, Interview with Robina Mapstone 1973

"During his all-too-brief life (he was 53 when he died), John von Neumann was regarded by many, including both prominent politicians and Nobel-prizewinning scientists, as the most intelligent person in the world."

"It is thanks especially to this article that an important axiomatic system of set theory has carried the name “Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory” for three or four decades already. There are two reasons why my good fortune was undeserved. First, the full significance of my new axioms was not immediately recognized and exploited by me, but instead—as previously mentioned—a year later by John von Neumann.

The most outstanding and at the same time versatile mathematician in the world in the second quarter of the twentieth century was Johann (later John) von Neumann (1903–1957).

It took considerable effort for me to work through the treatise, which not only deviated from everything that had thus far been published on the axiomatization of set theory, but it also contradicted previous ideas to the extent that it treated not sets but functions, and expressly permitted the “vast” areas that had been taboo for all predecessors. Far from understanding all that I read, I recognized from the small part I understood that the author must have a particularly extraordinary gift. To supplement our correspondence I therefore invited him to visit me in Marburg. His appearance made a huge impression not only on me, but also on my wife: the slim, not yet 20-year-old young man looked exactly as one would imagine a young genius. During the short time that he stayed with us, I made it clear to him that it would be hard to expect mathematicians all over the world to digest such radical new ideas all at once.

That same year, a completely different treatment by von Neumann appeared in a Hungarian journal, yet written in German. It was a short text within the usual axiomatic framework titled “Zur Einf€uhrung der transfiniten Zahlen” (Introduction to Transfinite Numbers). Except for a small algebraic article published in 1922, this was his first publication, and it immediately proved to be a masterpiece. “Classical” to a greater extent than his doctoral dissertation, it offered not only the first rigorous definition of transfinite ordinal numbers, which had been introduced by Cantor in 1883 and widely used since then, but it was also the first foundation of a method that had been used without hesitation in many areas of mathematics because it had (erroneously) been considered intuitively obvious: namely “transfinite induction.”"

-- Abraham Frankel, Recollections of a Jewish Mathematician in Germany

"Personal recollections of von Neumann are a staple in any history of computer science, but the truth seems to be that von Neumann was an overwhelming personality. Professor Leon Harmon, now a theoretical neurophysiologist at Case-Western University, has recollections that typify the stories told about von Neumann.

*Von Neumann was a true genius, the only one I’ve ever known. I’ve met Einstein and Oppenheimer and Teller and—who’s the mad genius from MIT? I don’t mean McCulloch, but a mathematician. Anyway, a whole bunch of those other guys. Von Neumann was the only genius I ever met. The others were supersmart .... And great prima donnas. But von Neumann’s mind was all-encompassing. He could solve problems in any domain. . . . And his mind was always working, always restless. He walked into my living room one night and a half dozen people were already having cocktails, and he disappeared into a corner and stood with his back to us, hands behind him, and after about two minutes turned to me and said, “About two thirds of a liter a week, Leon.” And I had to think about it for three or four minutes, and finally I said, “Yeah, Johnny, that’s just about right.” He’d walked up to the nine-gallon tropical fish aquarium that stood on a table in the corner, had noted the temperature of the water, had made an estimate of the surface area, had seen the gap that existed between the overhead light and the glass to keep the fish from jumping out, made an estimate of the particular escape velocity of the water molecules, integrated and found out how much added water was needed each week for that aquarium. And he was right within a few percent. That’s the kind of thing he did all the time. Another thing that he isn’t known well for was his sense of humor. He really enjoyed dirty limericks. And though we never said anything to each other deliberately, it sort of evolved that whenever we came together, whether it was an hour or a month later, the name of the game was to see who could rush up the fastest and unload the largest number of new limericks. It turned out to be a delightful game. He had oodles of them; I was hard put to keep up with him. His memory was just beyond conception, a photograph for everything he ever learned or saw. Lightning calculator and head screwed on to boot—he put all of those together with a huge creative talent.*"

-- Pamela McCorduck, Machines Who Think

"I have never met a mathematician of such impressive genius as von Neumann. The clear argumentative style of his publications also characterized his lectures and conversations. The ease with which he spoke about difficult problems irritated some, because they thought it was affected. Anyone who had once seen von Neumann solving a problem would no longer doubt the authenticity of this behavior. Reducing every problem to a trivial issue was Neumann's way of working. Von Neumann has received a number of awards that are not exactly impressive for a scholar of his stature. Our Academy can be proud that it was one of the few who valued his merits and welcomed him into their ranks. His passing is a great loss for the mathematical world and for our Academy."

-- Hans Freudenthal, 1957-58 Obituary of von Neumann (Google Translate translation of Dutch original)

"WHEN John von Neumann died in Washington on February 8th, 1957, at the height of his life, the world lost one of the greatest contemporary scientists. Though primarily a mathematician—and one of absolutely first order—he excelled in many other fields to which he made profoundly significant contributions. He was the first of the great, creative mathe­ maticians who gave prolonged attention to economic and social science. This is an historical fact of importance.

Eminence of the kind reached by von Neumann is rare in any one science—it is absolutely exceptional that it should occur in several. Yet
 this was the case, although in our time few can be at home in their own disciplines. Whatever field he touched was profoundly affected by his thought.

The universality of his mathematical genius did not stop here, because he was also deeply interested in applied mathematics. Indeed, one would have to go back far in the history of mathematics to find someone to equal him in this field.

It is against this background of massive work and unique achievement that von Neumann's work relating to economics must be viewed. Never before has a man with as wide and profound an acquaintance with mathe­matics and science concerned himself so deeply with our discipline.

The creation of the theory of games must be viewed as one of the greatest of von Neumann's achievements, and it has been heralded as such by many of his mathematical contemporaries.

Among mathematical economists there has until now been no one of the stature of von Neumann, and it may be long before a similar figure appears again.

Von Neumann exercised an unusually large influence upon the thought of other men in his personal relations. Few people can have been sought more eagerly, and he gave freely of his time. His stupendous knowledge, the immediate response, the unparalleled intuition held visitors in awe. He would often solve their problems before they had finished stating them. His mind was so unique that some people have asked themselves—they too eminent scientists—whether he did not represent a new stage in human mental development. It is impossible to convey a good picture without going into a detail for which this is not the proper place. As a mathe­matician, von Neumann was also gifted with an ability to calculate in his head so great that he would have been noteworthy had he never done any­ thing else. His memory never failed him; not only did he have at instant command the fabulous store of his scientific knowledge, but also the fruits of his general reading were readily available, whether procedural details of the trial of Joan of Arc, the involved genealogy of the Byzantine emperors or the battle descriptions of Thucydides. Poetry in many languages was familiar to him; even in the last days of his long illness would he sometimes quote at length from Latin authors. The flexibility of his mind made him a most entertaining companion: the powerful associations in his scientific thinking would then give way to innumerable and equally famous puns and jokes. No one who knew him personally could escape his charm and help but admire him. As a friend his loyalty was unsurpassed. Wherever he appeared it was an event.

Looking upon the whole of his work, one marvels that so much could be accomplished in so short a life. To state that we witnessed a com­bination of purest genius with a seemingly unbounded vitality and energy is a feeble way to give expression of the singularity of this man."

-- Oskar Morgenstern, 1958 Obituary of von Neumann

"For the time being, I am trying to delve into Neumann’s book. He truly is the brightest of them all."

-- Max Born, Letter to Schrödinger, June 28, 1935

"Johnny was a most unusual person, a marvellously quick thinker, and was recognized as a prodigy in high school.

These articles were written principally by me, but I felt that I had to express my gratitude to von Neumann for having introduced me to the work of Frobenius and Schur; therefore I proposed to him that we should publish them together. He was a marvellous mathematician and I never encountered another mathematician who was quicker or more knowledgable. He was one of the greatest mathematicians of the century, and I had great admiration for him.

Johnny (we called him 'Jancsi' in Hungary) was an even more outstanding person than Edward Teller, Leo Szilard, or myself. He was a *miracle*. When I met him, I was 13. 'Jancsi' von Neumann was a *very* unusual person. He was a marvellously quick thinker and was already recognised as such in high school. I had the feeling that he was a perfect instrumental with gears which have been machined to mesh accurately to one-thousandth of an inch. His knowledge of mathematics was fantastically great. He was much less interested in family and personal matters.

In a foreign country you have to excel. And this was very stimulating for us. Johnny von Neumann was different. He was a genius. He was brighter than anybody I met.

And probably broader. He was interested principally in mathematics. He worked in theoretical physics. He worked in economics, and he knew large parts of history as well as a professional historian. He spoke well Hungarian, German, English, also French and Italian, and he could read Latin and Greek. There are people who speak more languages than that, but he was a mathematician, not a linguist.

I am always happy to talk about him. He was indeed a genius. I have met many great scientists in my time. I knew Einstein, Planck, Laue -- I cannot enumerate them all. I knew everybody; Dirac is my brother-in-law, Heisenberg is a good friend of mine. But I have never known anyone as bright, intelligent, clever and quick on the uptake as János Neumann. Really, no one. This I mean literally, as I never fail to point out, even to my brother-in-law. I have never known a man with such a brilliant mind, such a penetrating grasp of detail and such a memory as János Neumann. You may think I am exaggerating. No, I am not exaggerating at all. That is what I think. There is a limit to everybody's knowledge and faculty of perception. So it was with Neumann. All the same, I have never known anybody with a clearer or quicker mind. If I wanted to know something and I asked Jancsi - for instance I might ask him to explain Warring's theorem - then he would ask: Do you know the 3rd theorem of Hilbert? No, I did not, I told him. Do you know D'Alambert's theorem - he would then ask. I said, yes, I do. And he would ask other questions. At least he would begin to explain Warring's theorem. He would make no reference in his explanation to Hilbert's 3rd theorem because I did not know about it. Instead he would refer to D'Alambert's theorem, developing it, and so leading me somehow along a winding path to what I wanted to know. He was a genius indeed. He understood things not in isolation but in relation to other things. And that is a rare gift.
Q: The President of the Atomic Energy Commission of the U.S. is said to have declared that if Neumann had taken a stand in any matter there was no need for further discussion.

What he actually said was: that if Neumann had analysed a problem, there was no need to discuss the matter at length; it was absolutely clear what was to be done.

Certainly. In history, for example. He knew the history of the Renaissance as well as any historian. He spoke five languages. And one more thing. I have never known any one who knew so many jokes. Neumann wa the best conversationalist I've ever known.

"Even before the present age of specialization, few people have ever contributed significantly to several branches of science, and all of them have a permanent record in the annals  of the history of science. John von Neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematics, physics, and economics. Furthermore, his contributions are not disjointed and separate remarks in these fields but arise from a common point of few. Mathematics was always closest to his heart, and it is the science to which he contributed most fundamentally.

The preceding three subjects are the ones which come to mind at once when writing about von Neumann's contributions to mathematics. However, they are surely not the only fields which have profited from his fertile imagination. He has made significant contributions to literally every branch of mathematics, with the exception of topology and number theory. His knowledge of mathematics was almost encyclopedic - again excepting the aforementioned two fields - and he gave help and advice on many subjects to collaborators and casual visitors, possibly to a greater extent than any other present-day mathematician. It would be very difficult to tell which of von Neumann's contributions to theoretical physic was more important: the direct or the indirect ones.

No appraisal of von Neumann's contributions to theoretical physics would be complete with a mention of the guidance and help which he so freely gave to his friends and acquaintances, both contemporary and younger than himself. There are well-known theoretical physicists who believe that they have learned more from von Neumann in personal conversations than from any of their colleague. They value what they have learned from him in the way of mathematical theorems, but they value even more highly what they have learned from him in methods of thinking and ways of mathematical argument.

It has been stated (By Copeland of Michigan) that his theory may be "one of the major scientific contributions of the first half of the 20th century."" 

-- H.H Goldstine and E. P. Wigner, The Scientific Work of John von Neumann

"Von Neumann made important contributions to all parts of mathematics, excepting number theory and topology, and he left his mark on theoretical physics and economics. His work during the war was vital for the success of several projects, and his contributions to the national welfare and national security did not cease, but rather intensified with the termination of the war. 

The relations between University and at least some of the high schools were quite close, and von Neumann became well known in the flourishing circle of Budapest's mathematicians even before he was graduated from high school. The spiritual father of many Hungarian mathematicians, L. Fejer, coined the phrase "our country's greatest Jancsi" and this appellation stuck with von Neumann throughout his life.

Von Neumann did not sever his connections with the Services and with the work on nuclear energy at the cessation of the hostilities, but devoted much of his time, his energy, his ingenuity, and his judgment to an effort to strengthen the armed power of his adopted country. His last years were entirely devoted to work for the Government, and he died, after several years of service, as a member of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, on February 8, 1957.

It would be impossible to describe adequately von Neumann's contributions to the sciences - mathematics, physics, economics, technology - in less than a dozen pages. 

Only an extraordinary mind could have made the unusual contributions to science which von Neumann made. The accuracy of his logic was, perhaps, the most decisive character of his mind. One had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch. "If one listens to von Neumann, one understands how the human mind should work," was the verdict of one of our perspective colleagues. Brilliance was the second, perhaps even more striking characteristic of von Neumann's mind. This property was clearly evident in the youth of fifteen. The third characteristic of his mind was its retentiveness. It was his exceptional memory which enabled him to pursue a host of hobbies, in addition to his scientific endeavors. He was an amateur historian as intimately familiar with long stretches of history as any professional. He spoke five languages well, was able to read Latin and Greek. He had read and remembered innumerable books, both fiction and popular summaries of other sciences. Of all the subjects this writer ever discussed with him, only the descriptive natural sciences did not arouse his interest. He was ever ready to help and he was genuinely interested in every problem that presented a challenge. I have learned more mathematics from him than from anyone else, and much more about the essence of creative thinking in mathematics than a lifetime’s study without him could have taught me. “If he analyzed a problem, it was not necessary to discuss it any further. It was clear what had to be done,” said the present chairman of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission.

A deep sense of humor and an unusual ability for telling stories and jokes
endeared Johnny even to casual acquaintances. He could be blunt when 
necessary, but was never pompous. A mind of von Neumann’s inexorable logic had to understand and accept much that most of us do not want to accept and do not even wish to understand. This fact colored many of von Neumann’s moral judgements. “It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.” Only scientific intellectual dishonesty and misappropriation of scientific results could rouse his indignation and ire - but these did - and did almost equally whether he himself, or someone else, was wronged.

His accomplishments were manifold, his was a great mind - perhaps one of the greatest of the first half of this century."

-- E. P. Wigner, John von Neumann (1903-1957)

"The far-reaching implications of the consequences of Heisenberg's ideas were first fully appreciated, I believe, by von Neumann, but many others arrived independently at conclusions similar to his.

On the opposite side, whenever I talked with the sharpest intellect whom I have known - with von Neumann - I always had the impression that only he was fully awake, that I was halfway in a dream.

The contemporary from whom I learned most - in fact immensely much - was von Neumann, but that was mostly mathematics."

-- Eugene Wigner, Symmetries and Reflections

"I have known a great many intelligent people in my life. I knew Max Planck, Max von Laue, and Werner Heisenberg. Paul Dirac was my brother-in-Iaw; Leo Szilard and Edward Teller have been among my closest friends; and Albert Einstein was a good friend, too. And I have known many of the brightest younger scientists. But none of them had a mind as quick and acute as Jancsi von Neumann. I have often remarked this in the presence of those men, and no one ever disputed me.

You saw immediately the quickness and power of von Neumann's mind. He understood mathematical problems not only in their initial aspect, but in their full complexity. Swiftly, effortlessly, he delved deeply into the details of the most complex scientific problem. He retained it all. His mind seemed a perfect instrument, with gears machined to mesh accurately to one thousandth of an inch.

Despite his singular achievements in mathematics, Jancsi was raised to be weIl rounded. He knew English almost as weIl as Hungarian, perhaps from a tutor engaged at home. Eventually, he also spoke fluent German, French, and ltalian. But Jancsi's intelligence never appalled me. He was clearly better in mathematics than I was. But so were many others; I was not a mathematics prodigy. And I knew more physics than he did.

And already I knew one boy far more intelligent than I was: Jancsi von Neumann. Von Neumann had decisively shown me the difference between a superb mind and all the rest of us.

Von Neumann understood it. He had not only the gift of cracking stubbom problems, but the far rarer ability to see their inner workings in perfect relation to any number of other, quite different concepts. Jancsi considered my group theory problem for about half an hour's time. Then he said, "Jenö, this involves representation theory."

Jancsi gave me a reprint of a decisive 1905 article by Frobenius and Schur. Von Neumann was both tactful and kind. He said, "You could perhaps work this out yourself, Jenö, but it's one ofthe things on which old Frobenius made his reputation. So it can't be easy."

After this incident, I began to ask Jancsi more often to make calculations for me. "Jancsi," I might say, "Is angular momentum always an integer of *h?"* He would return a day later with a decisive answer: "Yes, if all particles are at rest." He was proud of his computational prowess and liked to handle complex computations for his colleagues. We were all quite in awe of Jancsi von Neumann.

I relayed all these doubts to Jancsi von Neumann. We discussed the weIl-known gruppenpesters. Jancsi reassured me: "Oh, these are old fogeys. In five years, every student will learn group theory as a matter of course." And, as always, Jancsi was right. Soon all ofthem were learning "die gruppenpest" - even Wolfgang Pauli.

Promising as I might be as a physicist, it was clear to me that Princeton thought of me mainly as "the companion of Jancsi von Neumann."

Jancsi von Neumann and I had written three papers together in 1928 and two more in 1929. What a pleasure it was to work with von Neumann. I might be in Göttingen and he in Berlin. It did not matter. Each ofus worked effectively alone. If I found asnag, I presented it to Jancsi. There was never a snag that he could not untangle. He explained the most complex mathematical questions in a light, casual tone.

He was a consultant to both the Army and Navy. They would ask his opinion on various questions, saving him the hard ones. Jancsi would give his opinion, to which they would respond, "Very fine, Johnny. You know, you are really remarkably intelligent." Jancsi would grin. He knew very well that he was a genius; he had been hearing it since he was a 10-year-old boy studying higher mathematics in Budapest.

Once I asked Arthur Compton, "Say, why don't we bring von Neumann more closely into the project?" Compton enjoyed the suggestion, but he said that it was too late; we were too far along and Jancsi would have to master too much new material. I have no doubt that von Neumann could have caught up with us quite easily, and done far more for the Manhattan Project than he did. But he was never asked.

Szilard was quite persuasive, but he liked to quarrel with von Neumann, and at those times I was hard-pressed to like and agree with both of them. Von Neumann was usually right; he was a better scientist than Szilard and a far more selective quarreler.

Von Neumann's life had been a long series of brilliant achievements.

Jancsi was not only brilliant, but unfailingly kind to his fellows. He knew that guidance of one's peers is best done casually. He may have advised more work than any other modem mathematician. His own papers had an elegant power and rarely needed revision even years after.

Many of us failed to see its full value for years after, but Jancsi saw that computers could help solve problems in mathematics, physics, economics, industry, and even the military.

The computer made a graceful cap to von Neumann's career. Ever since he was a schoolboy, Jancsi had served as a kind of computer to his friends, always ready to make complex calculations. He had always loved axioms, and it was wonderful to see him writing axioms in computer language in his last years.

Jancsi spoke five languages and also read Latin and Greek. He had done important work in economics: the role of profits, the benefits of competition, and the best methods of developing national economies. He read widely and remembered it all, whether technical or literary. Large chunks of world history he knew thoroughly, especially Greek history. The history of the Renaissance he knew as thoroughly as a professional historian."

-- Eugene Wigner, The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner as told to Andrew Szanton

"Schwiebert: Between the lines of history there is much that never finds its way into the written record. From your own memory of ten years of involvement with the ballistic missile program, is there a single event or a single person that stands out in your mind?

Schriever: You have to separate people and events. Perhaps the one individual who stands out above all is the late Professor John von Neumann, because the ballistic-missile program would not have been possible without his efforts as chairman of two committees. One was the Teapot Committee, later renamed the Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee, which for the first time projected weapon technology some six to eight years into the future. This was in 1953. It really set the stage for the second von Neumann Committee under Trevor Gardner, which recommended that this country proceed on a high-priority basis to develop the ICBM. My association with John von Neumann goes back to the late 1940's and early 1950's, when I was very much impressed with his foresight and his willingness to look into the future, which is so important in weapon-system or delivery-system development.

The one event that stands out is the first time that von Neumann and Gardner and I briefed President Eisenhower in July, 1955. This briefing led to the establishment of the ballistic-missile program as the number-one national-priority effort.

Dr. von Neumann, a member of the General Advisory Committee to the Atomic Energy Commission, had studied the results of the recent laboratory tests, and from his own computations predicted the success of the later "Shrimp" shot.

The first real awareness of this requirement probably germinated in the proceedings of the Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee (the "Teapot Committee"), headed by Dr. John von Neumann, in late 1953."

-- Ernest G. Schwiebert, A History of the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missiles

"In the 1950s, von Neumann was the superstar defense scientist. No one could compete with his brain. At the Pentagon, the highest-ranking members of the U.S. armed services, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all saw von Neumann as an infallible authority. “If anyone during that crucial period in the early and middle-fifties can be said to have enjoyed more ‘credibility’ in national defense circles than all the others, that person was surely Johnny,” said Herb York, von Neumann’s close friend.

“Keeping up with him was impossible,” remarked the mathematician Israel Halperin. “The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car.”

“If a mentally superhuman race ever develops, its members will resemble Johnny von Neumann,” Edward Teller once said."

"In this century the American Mathematical Society has only twice published memorial issues of its "Bulletin," one to honor John von Neumann and the other for Norbert Wiener."

-- Michael A. Arbib, Talking Nets: An Oral History of Neural Networks

"Von Neumann was also a delight to be with. His brainpower stuck out in every direction (and his middle had expanded a bit, too). Like Fermi, he soaked up whatever work we described and made useful suggestions about it, also agreeing, more often than not, to give a general-interest talk in the Reines Raum.

To be sure, Fermi, von Neumann, and Bethe, who were the best of the best, agreed to continue as consultants"

"In retrospect, it marks the beginning of abstract analysis and led to the classic series of papers on Rings of operators, perhaps the most original major work in mathematics in the twentieth century."

-- Irving E. Segal, Review of Noncommutative geometry by Alain Connes

"John von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematical talents of the 20th Century, and a worthy successor to Poincare, Hilbert, and Weyl, in both intensity and breadth. His achievements are all the more impressive if one takes into consideration the short span of his life, and his very active national defense role during World War II and thereafter.

In addition to his personal research contributions he was immensely influential in general scientific terms, in a range extending from the abstraction of projective-like but continuous geometries to the practical application of high-speed computers. No single theme can adequately represent his broad scientific thrust."

"I do not know whether Hilbert regarded von Neumann's book as the fulfillment of the axiomatic method applied to quantum mechanics, but, viewed from afar, that is the way it looks to me. In fact, in my opinion, it is the most important axiomatization of a physical theory up to this time."

"Blackwell: Also, I had the chance to meet von Neumann that year. He was a most impressive man. Of course, everyone knows that.

So I did, and later I went in and started telling him about my thesis. He listened for about ten minutes and asked me a couple questions, and then he started telling *me* about *my* thesis. What you have really done is this, and probably this is true, and you could have done it in a simpler way, and so on. He was a really remarkable man. He listened to me talk about this rather obscure subject and in ten minutes he knew more about it than I did. He was extremely quick. I think he may have wasted a certain amount of time, by the way, because he was so willing to listen to second- or third-rate people and think about their problems. I saw him do that on many occasions."

-- Morris H. DeGroot, A Conversation with David Blackwell

"John von Neumann is one of the giants of modern mathematics. His career was marked by the founding and invention of a number of new fields of mathematics and by fundamental contributions to many others. His interests spanned pure mathematics, basic and applied science, mathematical analysis, the foundation of quantum mechanics, and scientific computing.

It documents, in a powerful and coherent fashion, a major current in the scientific and intellectual life of our times and the individual who have it birth.

Von Neumann believed in the power of mathematical reasoning and he believed in its importance to modern civilization. This belief, expressed through his life work, is the legacy of John von Neumann."

"It is also true that the rest of the mathematicians at the Institute took a slightly dim view of his computing experiments - and only allowed them to go on because of their deep respect for Von Neumann as a mathematician. But of course Von Neumann was not deterred by their misgivings and cheerfully predicted a great future for his vacuum tube machines. Still I do not think that even he expected the tremendous effect they have had on every phase of our daily lives today!"

-- Raoul Bott, On Mathematics

"In 1949, Princeton introduced him to an entirely new mathematical world. There were the great giants of the time — Albert Einstein, John von Neumann and Weyl, all refugees like himself from Nazi Germany — together with the leading Americans such as Oswald Veblen and Marston Morse."

-- Michael Atiyah, Obituary for Raoul Bott

"When he was at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1949–51, he once had a conversation with John von Neumann, a fellow Hungarian who was at the time a professor at the institute. Von Neumann told Raoul that he had known only one great mathematician, David Hilbert, and that having been a prodigy in his youth, he never felt that he had lived up to his promise. Raoul wrote in [3, Volume 4, p. 270], “So you see, it is not diﬃcult to be found wanting—one just needs an appropriate measuring rod.” If even von Neumann felt inadequate in his achievement in comparison with Hilbert’s, what chance for professional satisfaction do we ordinary mortals have?"

-- Loring Tu, Remembering Raoul Bott (1923-2005)

"Von Neumann combined, in a unique fashion, extreme quickness, very broad interests, and a fearsome technical prowess. The popular saying was:"Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants." Once in a discussion about the rapid growth of mathematics in modern times, von Neumann was heard to remark that whereas thirty years ago a mathematician could grasp all of mathematics, that is impossible today. Someone asked him: "What percentage of all mathematics might a person aspire to understand today?" Von Neumann went into one of his five-second thinking trances, and said: "About 28 percent.

Von Neumann was addicted to thinking, and in particular to thinking
about mathematics. Eisenhart surmised that his legendary quickness was
enhanced by his having thought before about a great many questions. The
obverse side of his compulsive thinking was a boredom with most mathematical discoveries except those that had something very surprising about them.

His official obligations left less time for scientific work, if not for the
doing of it, for recording it. He was willing to lecture on his work and
ideas, but didn't have the leisure to write them up for publication. He didn't
have much time for preparing them either; but so great was his power of
concentration that his lectures were models of good organization and his
sentences grammatically resplendent, with a slight tendency toward germanic length. After one of the rare occasions when he couldn't finish a proof he remarked ruefully: "I knew three different ways of proving this result, but unfortunately I chose a fourth way."

The tragedy of von Neumann's early death robbed mathematics and
the sciences of a natural leader and an eloquent spokesman, and deprived a
whole younger generation of beholding the most scintillating intellect of this
century."

-- Peter Lax, Remember John von Neumann

"When John von Neumann died in 1957, LIFE magazine (February 1957)
published the following tribute: Nobel Laureate physicist Hans Bethe said
of von Neumann, "I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von
Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man."

Throughout the world mathematicians and others had marvelled at the
lightning speed with which von Neumann analyzed and solved complex 
problems. In a memorial without precedent, the American Mathematical Society published a special 129 page Bulletin, May 1958, describing von Neumann's "brilliant mind, his warm personality, and his work which will live in  mathematics and the other sciences to which he contributed so much".

In this galaxy of stars von Neumann, a professor at the Institute, simply
radiated excitement.

At the daily afternoon tea he engaged some group in a most lively and stimulating discussion. With obvious delight he explained, clarified, and analyzed problems on the spot and gave help to one and all. But sometimes he would stand apart, deep in thought, his brown eyes staring into space, his lips moving silently and rapidly, and at such times no one ventured to disturb him."

-- Israel Halperin, The Extraordinary Inspiration of John von Neumann

"It is fair to say that the von Neumann and Birkhoff ergodic theorems
marked the beginning of ergodic theory and are so fundamental that it is
hard to think of a result in ergodic theory that does not make use of one
of these ergodic theorems. Dynamical systems arising from physics formed
the original context of these theorems but the fact that their proofs used only the measure theoretic structure of the dynamical system focused attention on measure-preserving transformations or flows on an abstract measure space.

The problem of classifying measure-preserving transformations or flows became a central problem in ergodic theory and von Neumann and Halmos were responsible for the first significant steps in this direction."

-- Donald S. Ornstein, Von Neumann and Ergodic Theory

"I attended some of von Neumann's lectures as an undergraduate more than fifty years ago, and saw him in a variety of capacities thereafter. He seemed a passionate lecturer, urbanely rational as a colleague, personally considerate, and almost  inhumanly powerful technically. More relevantly, he was a broad integrated personality whose work cannot be neatly categorized or linearized without misrepresenting its overall character. Much as he enjoyed and rose quickly to technical challenges, and resolved much more than his share of them, he seemed primarily concerned with the clear and viable formulation and development of fundamental scientific questions and issues, and only rather incidentally concerned with the solution of mathematical puzzles. The mathematical novelty implicit in quantum mechanics, and the divergence of its most fundamental form, i.e., quantum field theory, seemed outside the scope of traditional mathematics, spurring him toward fundamental mathematical innovation. At the same time the Wedderburn structure theory had a revival in various forms, and its extension to infinite-dimensional algebras ultimately provided an issue along purely mathematical lines that connected with quantum phenomenology. A decade later, the war focused his interests on  nonlinear partial differential equations, whose intractability motivated his program in high-speed computing. He worked in a total scientific way, in which the questions, which he formulated himself, are no less important than the answers. But at the same time he did provide a great many answers and created powerful mathematical instruments not less vital for the development of quantum physics than the new accelerators."

"1. Von Neumann's vision. Science was transformed by the invention of
calculus. The impact of computers upon science will be at least as large.
Across a broad front, computers will allow the transition from qualitative to quantitative and from descriptive to predictive. John von Neumann
foresaw that the equations describing scientific phenomena, once expressed in mathematical terms, could be solved numerically, without recourse to routine or repetitive experiment.

This vision is nothing less than the second half of the scientific revolution. Throughout four centuries we have expected that a successful scientific theory would have its major concepts expressed quantitatively as numbers and its major relationships expressed as mathematical equations; the truth of this theory was settled by experimental tests and hand calculations, often in idealized situations. The second half of the scientific revolution is no less sweeping in its goals. The solutions of the equations are also to be obtained on mathematical grounds, by numerical computation, without restriction to idealized cases.
Von Neumann is the founding father of modern scientific computing. His
work in the major areas of this field—numerical analysis, numerical 
algorithms, computations, mathematical modelling, and asymptotic analysis—stands today as vital and seminal."

-- James Glimm, Scientific Computing: Von Neumann's Vision

"What are we to make of all these experiences? Contrary to what the 
current literature about von Neumann suggests, he was not merely interested in computer design, or even only in computer science and technology as it is practiced today. Wiener's cybernetics of the 1940s, or today's cognitive science, may be a better fit; but even they do not encompass all of his interests in information processing, nor provide the organizing principle that seems to run through all his research.

Von Neumann's scientific interests were not confined by traditional disciplinary boundaries. His interest in information came from early experiences in physics, mathematical logic, and biology; and his proclivity towards interdisciplinary study, already present in his early work on quantum mechanics and game theory, was undoubtedly reinforced by his interdisciplinary activities during the second world war. The interest in biological information processing that evolved from these early experiences was strong, and remained with him throughout his career. Very likely he would have continued to pursue these subjects if his health had improved and his government duties diminished; and he would have been very interested in the work on DNA that came to fruition only shortly after his death. His contacts with the biomedical community were an important stimulus to his thinking about computing, one which he hoped and believed would contribute to the improvement of computer technology. Only by examining von Neumann in this larger scientific context do we gain a good measure of his plans and accomplishments."

"It is fair to say that von Neumann's paper founded the theory of reliable computation with unreliable components."

-- Nicholas Pippenger, Developments in "The Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components"

"The contributions of von Neumann advanced substantially in the direction of modern axiomatic set theory. But the fact that he established an important alternative to the ZFC system has led many authors to forget that he was also responsible for innovations in ZFC that have shaped its modern versions.

Von Neumann is a legendary figure of 20th century mathematics."

-- Jose Ferreiros, Labyrinth of Thought

"Von Neumann was a regular visitor to many of these centers until such visits were precluded by his commitments as an AEC commissioner. It is quite likely that his elevated status in the mathematical and government communities helped to legitimize the new discipline of numerical analysis and improve the flow of research funds. For all of these reasons, von Neumann should be regarded as one of the originators of the modern discipline of numerical analysis—a discipline renewed and refocused by the introduction of the computer."

-- William Aspray, The Transformation of Numerical Analysis by the Computer

"Rolf Landshoff, an emigrant from Berlin to the United States, who had belonged to Teller's group during the war, remembers in connexion with this 'racing' that there was a meeting in Teller's office with Fermi von Neumann, and Feynman in which T took part because I was to carry out the calculations planned at that meeting. Many ideas were thrown back and forth and every few minutes Fermi or Teller would devise a quick numerical check and then they would spring into action. Feynman on the desk calculator, Fermi with the little slide rule he always had with him, and von Neumann in hi, head. The head was usually first, and it is remarkable how close the three answers always checked.

We had at that meeting in June of 1951 every person, I think, that could conceivably have made a contribution. People like Norris Bradbury, head of the Los Alamos laboratory, and one or two of his assistants. Dr Nordheim, I believe, was there from Los Alamos, very active in the H programme. Johnny von Neumann from Princeton, one of the best weapons men in the world, Dr Teller, Dr Bethe, Dr Fermi, Johnny Wheeler, all the top men from every laboratory sat around this table and we went at it for two days."

-- Robert Jungk, Brighter than a Thousand Suns

"To mix metaphors, the grass didn't grow long under my feet. Next day, I called my commander. Gen. Ben Holzman, and requested authorization to travel to Princeton to meet with von Neumann. Also, if that were granted, would he please arrange the meeting. I was a pretty brash young man, but I felt that the chances of a greenhorn first lieutenant making any headway with a giant of von Neumann's stature were virtually nil unless I had a patron. Gen. Holzman grumbled a bit, but agreed to it if I traveled as extra crew on a military aircraft that was headed East anyway."

-- Philip Duncan Thompson, A History of Numerical Weather Prediction in the United States

"Von Neumann's paper to this point is a tour de force. With remarkable clarity, he establishes his theme, stripping away the complexity of actual 2-person, zero-sum, game situations - the elimination of 'draws', the creation of the concept of 'strategy', the suggestion of probabilistic play - establishing the basic axiomatic elements. Step by step, the reader is led to the point where each player has to make one move, i.e., choose a mixed strategy. Yet, when it comes to the actual proof that there exists a saddlepoint, the tone distinctly changes, and one is struck, not by the simplifying clarity, but rather the sheer bulldozing power with which von Neumann pursues the proof. It is an early testament to the remark, often made subsequently of him, that elegance in proof frequently gave way to something resembling brute force, in which he showed no fear of pursuing tangential arguments and taking the difficult, sometimes contorted, route. It quickly becomes difficult for even the mathematically qualified reader to retain the thread: individual passages are clear, but the reasoning linking them is not always, and the argument builds relentlessly. One finishes, satisfied somehow that von Neumann has indeed accomplished what he set out to do, but equally aware of the difficulty involved in following him. One begins to sympathize with his only doctoral student's description of him: "a magician, a magician in the sense that he took what was given and simply forced the conclusions logically out of it, whether it was algebra, geometry, or whatever. He had some way of forcing out the results that made him different from the rest of the people"

-- Robert Leonard, From Chess to Catastrophe

"Few would dispute John von Neumann’s, importance in the history of economic analysis in the twentieth century. This volume, largely centred round his 1937 paper on the model of an expanding economy, contends that von Neumann changed the very way in which economic analysis is done. His techniques have now become standard in modern economics, and his growth model led to the revival of classical political economy.

This volume, introduced by a Foreword from the late Lord Kaldor, will provide professional economists and graduate students alike with valuable insights into the work and significance of one of the century’s major economists.

I had of course heard of his reputation as the most brilliant student of mathematics—attested by his teacher the famous Professor Polya of Budapest University who declared that he was the most outstanding student he had ever known."
