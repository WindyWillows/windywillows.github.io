title: "John von Neumann's Work for the DoD and AEC"
tag: history
---

John von Neumann is one of the most important and influential mathematicians of the 20th century, and as a result of his fame has had a number of biographical texts written on him covering much of his life's work. However in the last period of his life in the late 1940s and 1950s von Neumann took on an increasingly important role within what would now be called the military-industrial complex. Initially working on ballistics at the Aberdeen Ballistic Research Laboratory he expanded his work to cover every single service within the US military baring the coast guard. His work on nuclear weaponry during the Manhattan Project expanded to cover both thermonuclear devices and their delivery mechanisms, ICBMs. This last work is rarely covered in almost all the biographical literature so far, likely owing to the fact much of it was (and much still is) classified. However there are still some pointers that would show his vital work in the roles he had.

A study of the box records for von Neumann from the Department of Energy (up to the Secret classification) reveals in addition to the above more specific details of some of the work he did. 

It includes correspondence with a large number of figures, many friends and colleagues well known such as Stan Ulam, Edward Teller, or Oswald Veblen however others not as well:

- Darol Froman, who held a senior position at Los Alamos
- Herman Hoerlin, a physicist who worked on high altitude nuclear explosions
- Frederic de Hoffmann, nuclear physicist
- Foster Evans, another physicist at Los Alamos
- Assistant Secretary of Defense in 1954, likely Donald A. Quarles
- Howard D. Greyber, astronomer
- J. W. Calkin, a mathematician who worked with von Neumann on functional analysis and later on nuclear weapons
- Merle Tuve, an applied physicist
- Marshall Rosenbluth, a plasma physicist
- John Wheeler, a physicist primarily known for work in general relativity
- Jerrold Zacharias, a nuclear physicist who also did work in air defense

It also included work on specific projects:

- Project Charles, on developing an air defense system for continental US
- Several boxes on guided and ballistic missiles, including titles such as "SAC-BALLISTIC MISSILE DEF COM", "SAB NUC PROPULSION-MISSILES", "DESIGN STRATEGIC AIR WEAPONS", "USAF-ATLAS", "DEFENSE AGAINST ICBM", "GUIDED MISSILE PROPOSALS"
- Many more on nuclear weapons more generally, "RUSSIA NUCLEAR WEAPONS", "LARGE YIELD WEAPONS", "NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN AIR DEFENSE", "FALLOUT", "COSMIC CONTROL", "DISARMAMENT"
- Some are regarding committees von Neumann served on, "SAB NUC WEAPONS PANEL", "USAF TEA POT COMM. CORRES.", "TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL ON AE", "SAC BALLISTIC RESEARCH LAB"
- Several folders are seemingly related to the SM-64 Navaho missile
- There are several references to a certain Project Pelican under the AFSWP, I can't find any information on it online and it's classified under Secret so this is likely remains an unreleased military project from the early 1950s.
- A certain "PLATO REPORT", likely to be this [5]
- Another mystery "PROJECT TYPHOON" from 1949 and Classified.
- Dozens of folders are on topics in fluid dynamics such as explosions, detonations, blast waves, shock waves, various kinds of flows, subsonic supersonic, mach effect, underwater, under ballistic conditions, and so on.
- At least 12 folders of mathematical computations
- A folder on the Picatinny Arsenal
- Several folders on different kinds of mathematical problems such as boundary value problems likely connected with his above work
- A folder on "HOLIFIELDS' COMMITEE", likely referring to Chet Holifield's chair of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
- A folder on "LULEJIAN REPORT", a secret 1954 report by Lt. Col. N. Lulejian on radiation hazards in atomic warfare, this is also listed as Secret although the report has since been declassified
- Various folders connected with his other governmental work for agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Office for Scientific Research and Development, or more military minded agencies such as the NSA
- Some folders on computation and correspondence with commercial computing companies
- 14 folders on "PROJECT HURRICANE", likely referring to early British atomic weapons testing under the name Operation Hurricane
- Several folders on correspondence with members of the US Navy, such as Admiral Parsons or the Chief of Naval Operations
- Many more folders on topics in shock wave theory such as the Munroe effect or "RE-ENTRY PROBLEM-HIGH TEMP AIR"
- A folder labeled "REQUIREMENTS-WS107A" likely regarding parts of the Atlas ICBM.
- A folder titled "DISASTER PLAN"
- Many more items of interest...
