title: "Resources on Algebraic Quantum Field Theory"
tags: math physics resources
---

Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) is one of the main axiomisations of quantum field theory. While not reaching mainstream knowledge amongst theoretical physicists AQFT is a key area within mathematical physics where many structural results have been obtained. Within the past 20 years however the field has had a renaissance where recently developed mathematics has proven useful in making advances to connect it with more mainstream quantum field theory (QFT) techniques. The traditional axioms of Haag-Kastler have been modified by those of locally covariant AQFT and again in perturbative AQFT and homotopical AQFT, which have not yet reached a satisfactory form yet.

The local quantum physics crossroads serves as a homepage for the general AQFT community where new papers are posted, conferences advertised, and jobs listed:

<a href="https://www.lqp2.org">https://www.lqp2.org/</a>

The ncatlab is a Wikipedia type site created specifically to promote category theory style thinking, and while this also means that it may seem rather abstract and obtuse it has the added benefit of being maintained by a small group of academics who often add interesting commentary that is not easily found:

<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AQFT">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AQFT</a>

These encyclopaedia cover a wide range of mathematical physics and contain useful small introductions to the many friends that make up the field, if you want to find something interesting all you have to do is dig in and you will surely find something suitable to your interests:

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780323957069/encyclopedia-of-mathematical-physics">Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Physics</a> (2nd Edition)

Many mathematicians and physicists work on AQFT and similar ideas worldwide, however there are a smaller core of people who have spent large parts of their careers working on it, here I have tried to list them to some extent so it is easier to the most recent research material. All links are to inspirehep, which in addition to displaying papers also displayers references too:

arXiv submission categories relevant to AQFT:

[Mathematical Physics:](https://arxiv.org/archive/math-ph) This is the main category that AQFT submissions would come under.

[High Energy Physics - Theory:](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-th) Some content may be more biased towards physical applications and especially for physicists who use AQFT for their work without being concerned in particular for the mathematical details their submissions may come under this category, as it included quantum field theory generally.

[General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology:](https://arxiv.org/archive/gr-qc) Work biased towards quantum gravity is often included here as are results on black hole theory.

[Operator Algebras:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.OA/recent) As this is the main area of mathematics involved in AQFT naturally results here may be directly relevant to the subject.

[Differential Geometry:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.DG/recent) QFT, being built on gauge theory, naturally is in the language of differential geometry and hence results here are sometimes relevant to a rigorous formulation of QFT.

[Symplectic Geometry:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.SG/recent) This field forms a natural mathematical language for Hamiltonian mechanics and geometric quantisation, and the category also occasionally collects results in Poisson geometry and deformation quantisation, all of which are relevant to AQFT.

Other arXiv categories of interest:

[High Energy Physics - Lattice:](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-lat) Some QFTs, eg Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) only have effective work done on them through lattice field theory, and thus keeping an eye on the literature here is good for those looking to keep up to date with QCD literature.

[High Energy Physics - Phenomenology:](https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-ph) While mathematical physics is good for finding motivation for studying certain mathematical topics, on the physics side those looking to find connection with experiment and the real world will find QFT results for such topics here.

[Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics:](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.CO/recent) AQFT on curved spacetimes has implications for cosmology, and while the GR-QC category often included more theoretical results this category is more biased towards experimental results dealing with cosmology and black hole physics.

[History and Philosophy of Physics:](https://arxiv.org/list/physics.hist-ph/recent) Useful to keep up with philosophy of physics and how some of the problems in modern physics are viewed by philosophers.

[History and Overview:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.HO/recent) Likewise for mathematics.

[Algebraic Topology:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.AT/recent) Homotopical AQFT heavily draws on results from algebraic topology and category theory and hence results from those views may be relevant to those on the cutting edge of research.

[Category Theory:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.CT/recent) Likewise as above.

[K-Theory and Homology:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.KT/recent) Likewise as above.

[Analysis of PDEs:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.AP/recent) PDE theory is always advancing and many recent advances in AQFT have come from tools in PDEs.

[Functional Analysis:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.FA/recent) While the operator algebra category would contain the most useful new results in analysis for AQFT there is much more available in this category, although more much that would also be irrelevant.

[General Topology:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.GN/recent) One of the key prerequisites for functional analysis, there is usually little of direct relevant to physics but rather useful for finding new ways to think about topological spaces.

[Representation Theory:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.RT/recent) New algebraic structures are always found and old ones analysed which may have relevance to QFT.

[Rings and Algebras:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.RA/recent) Likewise as above.

[Quantum Algebra:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.QA/recent) Likewise as above.

[Probability:](https://arxiv.org/list/math.PR/recent) For a while now probability theory has been presenting new results in mathematical physics, results here are closer to solving the QFT and mass gap than any other program.

Other Preprint Sites of Interest:

Pittsburgh Philosophy of Science Archive, a sort of arXiv for PoS papers:

https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu

The following is a list of journals useful to those interested in AQFT, I have tried to list them by relevance, before adding some on the end which are either more physics centred (journals for astrophysics or cosmology for example) or more mathematical (general mathematical journals or on specific fields such as functional analysis or differential geometry), before adding a few philosophy of science journals at the end.
