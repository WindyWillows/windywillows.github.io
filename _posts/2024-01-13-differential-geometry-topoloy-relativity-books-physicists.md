title: "Books on Differential Geometry, Topology & Mathematical Relativity for Physicists"
tags: math physics resources

Differential geometry and topology are now standard tools not just for a small group of mathematical physicists but for everyday theorists too and in particular those working in high energy physics and allied fields as differential geometry provides a natural language for describing field theories. While differential geometry is also used as the base for general relativity in the form of Lorentzian geometry, much of modern research is interested rather in using it as a base for gauge theories.

This list contains books aimed at physicists dealing with topics in differential geometry and topology sorted by publish date. Many also include applications to gauge theory. For books that have multiple versions I have only denoted the most recent one (in particular Dover republishes classic titles so their books, while having a recent publish date, may in fact be a decade or more older).

Interestingly for one of the other major areas of advanced mathematics used in physics, functional analysis, almost all books focus entirely on quantum mechanics and avoid going into the more advanced topics that might be useful for mathematical quantum field theory.



Books that I've read to be on a particularly advanced level I have denoted with a star \*:
