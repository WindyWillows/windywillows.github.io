title: "Useful Math & Physics Book Series'"
tags: math physics resources
---

There are a large variety of book series published by well known academic publishers such as Springer and Cambridge University Press, however almost all of them are unknown to everyday students. Here I have collated a list of useful book series' that would be relevant to students primarily in mathematics & theoretical physics, although I have added a few additional ones for students in STEM more broadly.

A quick note on ability differentiation, although book series' may be marketed towards a certain level, it is certainly possible that stronger students from a weaker background may be able to pick up and learn content, for example it is common that strong undergraduate students can pick up graduate level work. In this list if I am in doubt or if the series specifically notes they cater to multiple levels I have places that series under the graduate student level.

<p style="text-align: center">For Undergraduate Students -</p>
<br>

<a href="https://www.springer.com/series/3423">Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series</a> (Springer)

* This series is relatively newish and targeted towards a lower level, however many books provide either partial or full solutions which make it an excellent choice for those with basic undergraduate knowledge in mathematics (that may have come from degrees such as engineering and physics) and want to self study a topic rather than learn it formally.

  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089MBNRYT?binding=paperback

<a href="https://www.springer.com/series/666">Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics</a> (Springer)

* This classic series publishes undergraduate targeted books in a wide variety of areas traditionally however more recently I have noticed they have tended to publish on analysis more than any other area.

<a href="https://www.springer.com/series/15593">Undergraduate Texts in Physics</a> (Springer)

<a href="https://www.springer.com/series/8917">Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics</a> (Springer)
