Hi, my name is Daniel and I study mathematics and computer science at UWA.

I can provide friendly 1 on 1 tutoring either at your home (Willetton  area) or at the Willetton or surrounding local libraries on almost any  topic at school level for mathematics, physics or computer science. In  addition for students wanting to learn more for further study of these  subjects at the university level (for example linear algebra, classical  mechanics or programming), I can provide guidance on what you will learn in the future and where you can find the appropriate resources catered  specifically to your aspirations and needs.

I have experience  tutoring students from year 8 up to the university level and am happy to discuss things not just in the tutoring session but in more informal  settings too when you have tests or assignments coming up so that you  may achieve to the best of your ability.

I am well versed in the  skills required to succeed in these subjects and can provide guidance on the kind of things that teachers and exam markers are looking for in  your work and more generally on how to build strong study and research  skills that are necessary for your further education. My personal  interests are in mathematical physics and software development.

I charge a flat $50/hour rate which also includes help outside of direct  tutoring sessions when I am available. Outside of academics I play tennis competitively, follow the EPL, and like memes :)
