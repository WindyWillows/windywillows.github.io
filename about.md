I am a curious cat. This is my blog where I discuss topics of interest to me. Broadly this is in STEM and anything that can be described to be of significance to the world "globally".

In STEM my interests in particular revolve around modern approaches to the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory (primarily perturbative AQFT) and the wide range of mathematics involved in this. For a more concrete topic list:

Functional Analysis: Operator Algebras, Microlocal Analysis, Topological Vector Spaces

Differential Geometry: Pseudo-Riemannian & Lorentzian Geometry, Symplectic Geometry

Global Analysis: Analysis of Hyperbolic PDEs, Analysis on Infinite-Dimensional Manifolds

Algebra: Representation & Lie Theory, Homological Algebra, Homotopical & Higher Algebraic Structures

My interest in things that involve the world "globally" are typically topics such as geopolitics & international relations, philosophy & ethics, mass psychology, history, macroeconomics, computers & modern technology, and in general how the society that I live in is progressing in the general sense.

These interests are conjoined by my interest on John von Neumann*, a unique 20th century mathematician and scientist. His life in the decades of 1900-1960 broadly follows the progress of many modern ideas that permeate the world today. From this I have also developed a reasonably large knowledge on the history of mathematics and fundamental physics during that time period.

This blog exists primarily so I can clarify my own thoughts on certain topics however I hope it may find use to others somewhere in the interwebs. As such I may update posts when I feel I have something to reword or add, and my posts contain a small version marking at the bottom to identify this.

* While I possess no formal education in history or the humanities in general, the author of the 2021 award winning biography of him, Ananyo Bhattacharya, did once offer to help me write a full blown book on him.
